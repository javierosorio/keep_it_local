1- translating data text using the three tools: 
1. Google API.
2. Transformers.
3. Deep Learning.
2- The second task evaluates the translation quality assessment using four metrics: 
1. BLEU.

Each task is accompanied by a comprehensive readme file within its assigned folder, offering clear instructions and guidance to help users understand and replicate the translation process and quality assessment.
