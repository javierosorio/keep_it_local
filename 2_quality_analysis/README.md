# Translation Quality Evaluation Analysis
This directory consists of two primary components: scripts and results for the two main tasks of the study. The first task involves translating data text using the three tools: Google API, Transformers, and a Deep Learning package. The second task evaluates the translation quality assessment using four metrics: BLEU, SacreBLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore.

Each task is accompanied by a comprehensive readme file within the scripts folder, offering clear instructions and guidance to help users understand and replicate the translation process and quality assessment.
