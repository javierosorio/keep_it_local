2010/s/pv_6276/69:3	I would also like to reiterate that the four members of the Armed Forces of Timor-Leste convicted of manslaughter in the shooting deaths of eight members of the National Police of Timor-Leste in 2006, one of whom was pardoned and three of whom benefited from reduced sentences, They have yet to pay court-ordered compensation to the victims' widows.	1
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/275:2	These positions are considered indirect participation in obscuring the positions of the Syrian government regarding what is happening on its territory, and irresponsible incitement to violence in all its forms, which would give international cover for the terrorist acts carried out by armed groups against the interests of the Syrian people and government.	1
2011/s/pv_6490/50:1	Let's be frank: these reports from the press, human rights groups and civilians on the ground raise serious concerns about the nature and scope of the conflict.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/171:2	Leaders of the provisional institutions of self-government often evade their responsibilities under resolution 1244 (1999) and the constitutional framework.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/200:1	Among these concerns, one concern must be highlighted, which is the deteriorating security situation in recent weeks and months.	1
2010/s/pv_6365/53:2	It is with great concern that I must report to you again today that, despite the great efforts of UNAMID, the security situation in Darfur has not improved significantly.	1
2012/s/pv_6735/131:2	The social and economic challenges facing Afghanistan are great.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/55:3	These regulations cover campaign finance, electoral activities, public order, access to the media and the misuse of government resources for political purposes.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/164:1	Finally, the widespread institutional, cultural, ethnic and spiritual diversity in societies currently experiencing profound historical change may give rise to particular tensions and security concerns.	1
2006/s/pv_5603/302:4	A real awareness of the challenges facing each country is emerging.	1

2008/s/pv_5930/308:1	In conclusion, the challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous, but we are making progress.	1
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/123:2	We are concerned about the deterioration of the living standards of the people as a result of the hardships faced by the country in 2008, in particular as a result of the global food crisis and the damage caused by the hurricanes that struck the island.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/255:1	But there was also concern because every glimmer of hope in the Middle East was met with escalating violence and destruction.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/99:2	In particular, I would like to stress, as stated in the report, that the Taliban continue to represent a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and that containing that organization is crucial.	1
2012/s/pv_6735/124:1	However, Afghanistan still faces challenges in its quest for stability and development. The main challenges include the security situation, the worsening humanitarian situation, challenges related to the rule of law and human rights, and continuing violence, leading to increasing civilian casualties.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/289:1	Fourth, piracy off the coast of Somalia is an international problem that requires our collective efforts and contributions.	1

2007/s/pv_5693/72:2	We strongly condemn the brutal attack that took place this morning on the shrine of Imams Ali al-Hadi and Hassan al-Askari in Samarra, and we share the Iraqi people’s feeling of anger over this crime. It is another planned attempt by terrorists to sow the seeds of discord and ignite the flames of sectarian conflict among the people of Iraq.	1
2010/s/pv_6353/57:6	This means that the separatists continue their blatant disregard for international law and rejection of the universal principles of the United Nations Charter.	1
2006/s/pv_5466/50:3	We stressed the recent tragic effects of such messages on other parts of the continent.	1

2011/s/pv_6618/67:4	So far there is no improvement in reform management at the national level.	1
2007/s/pv_5693/171:1	We raise the issue of violence in order to express our impatience with regard to finding satisfactory and urgent solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/65:1	I am concerned that this parliamentary vote and the stalemate within Parliament could lead to the hard-won gains of the Somali stakeholders and their partners being wasted.	1
2011/s/pv_6495/75:5	In all these discussions, I was heartened to discover a convergence of views: we all marvel at how much Liberia has achieved since the fighting ended in 2003, but everyone is fully aware of the magnitude of the challenges that still face Liberia, and that we take nothing for granted. Of him in the end.	1
2004/s/pv_5024/98:4	Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian ad hoc court process, additional remedial measures may be required to achieve justice.	1
2012/s/pv_6735/61:4	This is unacceptable, and even contradicts the declared ban by anti-government forces on the use of landmines.	1

2006/s/pv_5492/42:1	The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon - approved by this Council six years ago - would bring security along its northern border, found themselves exposed to continuous missile attacks from Hezbollah, which day after day reach deeper into Israeli territory.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/228:5	The number of attacks targeting national and international security forces, employees of public institutions, workers in the humanitarian fields, and representatives of countries has increased. Attacks against polling sites also increased and threats against voter registration teams increased.	1
2009/s/pv_6111/60:4	Recent incidents of indiscipline in the Integrated Security Detachment have made this clear, in particular the allegation that an Integrated Security Detachment commander killed a civilian in Farshana on 22 March.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/309:2	We note that the continuing challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/137:1	At the same time, my delegation believes that elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, especially Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their constituents if they adopted a more participatory approach, rather than withdrawing from the Assembly whenever they faced a difficult situation.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/229:2	We should not underestimate the seriousness of the threat posed by the destabilizing activities of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.	1
2011/s/pv_6656/57:2	While neither side appears ready to return to war, there is a worrying pattern of escalation and destabilization that could lead to a large-scale confrontation that could put more civilian lives at risk.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/140:2	However, the situation inside Kosovo today remains a matter of concern to us.	1
2010/s/pv_6353/179:1	Like other speakers who have spoken before us, and in line with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the action that led to the death of Mr. Dzikovic and the injury of several other people during the protests in Mitrovica North on 2 July.	1

2012/s/pv_6709/56:1	Recent developments in the region confirm the concerns long expressed to the Mission by its interlocutors.	1
2007/s/pv_5693/199:1	We also note that the escalation of violence forces residents of entire regions to leave to flee the violence.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/186:2	These actions are completely unacceptable. The Palestinian Authority must put an end to these attacks and prosecute their perpetrators.	1
2007/s/pv_5693/252:1	From our previous discussions, Belgium shared the Secretary-General's concern about the danger that the violence in Iraq poses to a society, institutions and political process that is still fragile.	1

2010/s/pv_6276/216:1	In conclusion, despite the great progress achieved by Timor-Leste, it still faces many serious challenges as it seeks to achieve stable democracy and develop its economy.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/252:5	The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees for its security as a state.	1
2009/s/pv_6230/187:2	It is clear that this was due to the aforementioned countries' rejection of his measures.	1
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/387:2	It is important to give women, who are the primary victims of violence in all its manifestations, a major role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and what is even more important and urgent is to do so in the process of conflict prevention.	1
2010/s/pv_6365/52:4	However, challenges remain on the path to achieving lasting peace and stability in Darfur.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/171:4	These measures are being taken despite the clear negative position taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and are considered a challenge to the United Nations and the Security Council.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/124:2	The alarming drug situation calls for further action.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/233:1	The challenge is to ensure that our anger is translated into specific, purposeful action that produces early, measurable results.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/254:4	Rather, they insist on treating the case as a secondary immigration crime.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/97:2	I also say today what I said on January 31. (See session S/PV.6710). It is unacceptable to prevent the Council from assuming its responsibilities.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/168:2	His mission represents the last chance to prevent Syria from sliding into civil war.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/353:5	This is despite the repeated condemnation of these inhumane acts by Security Council Resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), which have become a source of hope for millions of women and girls victims around the world.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/66:5	The second reason is to once again call on the Security Council to undertake urgent and necessary action to stop the bloodshed in Syria.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/273:1	In the face of this blatant threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without resorting to the double standards that characterized its previous work in this regard, so that it can urgently and decisively adopt the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the members of the Arab Group.	1
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/40:1	The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to remind all speakers, as I indicated in the morning session, to limit their statements to no more than five minutes, so that the Council can complete its work quickly.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/324:2	In our view, cross-border infiltration is not the primary cause of violence committed by extremists in Afghanistan, including in the south and southeast.	0
2010/s/pv_6431/36:1	The session opened at 10:16.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/253:1	Despite the difficulties we face when reading the report before us, it identifies the challenges facing us.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/291:1	In conclusion, in the context of peace in the world and the Middle East, I would like to stress that while we understand all the emerging and security-related needs, it is better for that region and the world at large if the situation in Iran is stopped from moving towards conflict because it would be the kind of conflict that could It has a very unfortunate impact on the world, as it will be the last straw that breaks the camel's back in terms of world peace.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/153:1	We are deeply concerned by the fact that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated by one side against the other, despite the clear expressions of disgust by the international community and the Security Council.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/176:3	It also appears that quite a few logistical needs must be met in order for the delivery to be completed.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/317:3	Kosovo, given its current political status, remains far from foreign direct investment and lacks eligibility for IMF and World Bank programmes and assistance, which would have a direct impact on the creation of a stable and efficient economy.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/215:4	This is an important step in the right direction.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/56:3	Tensions along the border could turn into serious violence during the migration period in the Abyei Area, from which neither side has completely withdrawn.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/97:3	This will require more forceful measures to expel those who, through threats of violence, illegally use Serb property.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/71:2	The first is that claims to human rights and freedom are universal and will become universal over time, because they are basic human aspirations.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/195:7	We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to comply with the commitment set out in resolution 2036 (2012) to ban trade in Somali charcoal, in particular by those most active in this trade.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/172:6	Israel has legitimate security concerns, but those concerns can only be fully and effectively addressed through a negotiated settlement.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/230:1	At the same time, we are concerned by the observation in the report that work on demarcating the land border between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is not progressing quickly.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/65:2	This is important to strengthen the Mission's ability to provide meaningful protection to the Congolese civilian population, which has fallen victim to a clear humanitarian catastrophe, as Mr. Doss emphasized, and to widespread human rights violations, in particular acts of violence against women and children.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/185:1	The UK knows, perhaps better than most around this table, given our role as a leading nation, the magnitude of another long-term challenge: the challenge of counter-narcotics.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/114:2	Therefore, I focused more on opportunities than challenges in my statement.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/220:1	Actions that may reduce confidence in or harm the outcome of negotiations must stop and be reversed.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/219:4	The blockade must be lifted immediately to allow the civilian population of Gaza to access water, work, trade, medical care and education - that is, their basic needs.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/263:1	I would like to remind speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes so that the Council can complete its work quickly.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/218:1	My delegation remains concerned about the continued deterioration of the security situation in Iraq.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/151:3	We must reject any attempts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	1
2007/s/pv_5693/92:3	Thus, the terrorists failed to achieve their strategic goal of preventing the participation of large numbers of volunteers in rebuilding the country.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/135:3	We were prevented from even condemning the violence and supporting a peace plan drawn up by Syria's neighbors.	1
2011/s/pv_6656/93:1	Of great concern is the intense rhetoric from both sides, the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/247:1	Once again, Egypt demands an immediate halt to Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.	1
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/246:3	It outlines issues that require attention and concludes - with the encouragement of Somali women - that the international community should raise issues of gender equality, including with Somali leaders.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/185:1	Despite the overall progress, it must be noted that poverty and unemployment still pose a huge challenge, Ms. Amira Haq stressed.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/255:2	We are deeply concerned that the ad hoc process created for this purpose has failed.	1
2011/s/pv_6495/51:2	However, the challenges involved will be much greater, as they will be single-day events, and logistics will be complicated by Liberia's heavy rainy season.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/252:2	However, the Chad experience has left a strong imprint on European peacekeepers, and has heightened our awareness of the challenge facing the United Nations in that regard.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/111:4	Combating this scourge requires strengthening our criminal prosecution capacity, our judicial system, our civilian police, and even our prison system.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/257:2	We have noted with concern the Secretary-General's assessment that many of the factors that sparked the 2006 crisis remain in society, making it vulnerable to instability.	1
2011/s/pv_6490/42:1	We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d'Ivoire, as the Council may have attested in the statement I made earlier today.	1
2002/s/pv_4583/45:2	He also stresses that it is Rwanda's duty to use its strong influence to ensure that the RCD does not take such actions.	1
2010/s/pv_6297/68:1	The ability of national security forces to respond to these threats in remote areas remains limited by capacity constraints.	0
2012/s/pv_6708/46:4	The important challenges and issues related to security and national reconciliation that, in my view, require the political attention of the Council should not be underestimated.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/260:2	According to these decisions, this body must demand that the United States government immediately sentence Luis Posada Carriles for committing acts of terrorism or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose judicial system has been pursuing him for years.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/154:2	More efforts must be made by the Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations in preventive activities, such as providing sanitation and safe water.	1
2011/s/pv_6544/46:1	“The Council expresses deep concern over reports of an unusual and sudden influx of thousands of Misseriya tribe members into Abyei town and its surrounding areas, which may bring about significant changes in the ethnic fabric of the region.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/361:2	We must now accelerate action to implement our mutual commitments.	0
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/137:2	The European Union truly believes that strong socio-economic development is required to maintain and consolidate the nascent stability.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/216:1	Whatever its own capabilities, any country in our region cannot confront the challenges of terrorism, secession, and development alone and win the stakes of openness and democracy.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/251:3	The mission's requirements related to resolution 1325 (2001) were more specific and detailed during the deployment of EUFOR compared to the subsequent deployment of UNMIS forces.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/143:1	As serious and reprehensible as that incident is, it is an isolated incident.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/135:2	Conflicts have complex root causes that involve multiple factors, including political differences, unequal distribution of economic resources, and tribal clashes. The possibility of renewed and extension of the conflict still exists. Establishing peace will continue to require tireless efforts on the part of all parties.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/174:2	All concerned must ensure that Kosovo is a place of ethnic tolerance and pluralism for communities to enjoy peaceful coexistence.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/64:3	I believe that the combination of his assuming this role and Ambassador Jureka's chairmanship of the Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee has created new vitality in our work to combat terrorism.	0
2012/s/pv_6708/48:1	The holding of legislative elections without delay and in a relatively peaceful atmosphere is, in our view, a major achievement that represents a major step forward in restoring constitutional order, more inclusive governance, and concluding the remaining key aspects of the peace process.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/177:2	The peoples of the world as a whole demand universal human rights.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/191:2	In this regard, the recommendations made by the Evaluation Team to prevent the spread of conflicts, destabilize States and exacerbate humanitarian problems deserve close attention.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/159:1	We urge Israel to adhere to its obligations with regard to the population in the occupied territories.	1
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/330:1	In post-conflict settings, the challenges facing women remain enormous.	0
2010/s/pv_6259/68:3	However, failure to intervene effectively to restore stability in that country truly threatens the effectiveness of the international community, in addition to costing it enormous resources.	1
2008/s/pv_6024/140:1	Despite all efforts to restore peace and security, we remain concerned about the recent major setbacks to stabilization efforts in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	1

2003/s/pv_4770/113:3	We see that there are great achievements and signs of optimism in this direction.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/151:4	This is an international obligation that States must fulfill to ensure justice for the victims of these reprehensible acts.	1
2010/s/pv_6353/103:1	He informed councilors that all necessary steps have been taken and will continue to be taken to arrest the perpetrators as quickly as possible.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/60:2	Not only is the election schedule clearly visible, but the situation along Liberia's border with Côte d'Ivoire requires close monitoring for potential security implications.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/234:1	In this regard, although the fight against terrorism is being treated more seriously by the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular, there is limited evidence of real joint efforts to find a greater international response to terrorism.	1
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/55:1	We know that conflict situations are often characterized by a breakdown of law and order.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/224:3	Our main concern in that regard is the fact that, for the report, none of the eight key standards have yet been fully implemented.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/111:1	Afghanistan will face critical challenges in the coming months.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/34:1	The situation in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo	0
2009/s/pv_6234/43:1	“The Security Council notes with deep concern the postponement of the first round of the presidential elections, which were scheduled to take place on 29 November 2009 in accordance with the communication of the Permanent Advisory Framework of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement of 18 May 2009, endorsed by all Ivorian political actors.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/122:2	Monitoring and identification of violations of the arms embargo must be strengthened, and targeted sanctions applied where appropriate, in order to limit the potentially destructive effects of that process in the Somali context.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/298:3	Timor-Leste has made important steps towards addressing its difficult legacy, but significant and pressing challenges remain.	0
2010/s/pv_6259/66:4	Protecting civilians is a long-neglected duty in Somalia.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/64:3	The dissident group of parliamentarians rejected the Garowe process and put forward a proposal to move the presidential elections forward from July to April 30 this year.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/73:1	The overall challenge is to take the incremental steps that have been implemented, intensify them and make them transformative.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/134:1	First, let me stress the importance of building on the current negotiations, including the Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Syrian tracks.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/239:5	However, it is unacceptable for Israel to use its legitimate security concerns as a justification for imposing measures that affect an entire population in an arbitrary manner and in violation of international humanitarian law.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/252:3	But we are concerned that a key factor in decision-making is being undermined by the lack of political consensus.	1
2012/s/pv_6709/188:3	While the region's leaders took bold measures to combat this scourge, the Libyan crisis erupted and exacerbated the situation.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:3	A gender perspective must be part of the reform and training of all security forces.	1

2012/s/pv_6735/158:1	The first issue is the drug situation in Afghanistan, which poses a serious and growing challenge not only to Afghanistan but to other countries of the world as well.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/182:2	We are concerned about the lack of political freedoms there.	1
2006/s/pv_5597/80:2	In this regard, we would like to repeat what we said on previous occasions, which is that the most dangerous thing this investigation faces is the continued exploitation of some parties, in our region or outside it, of the investigation proceedings to jump to preconceived political conclusions that are not relevant to the requirements of the investigation and are not based on evidence. And solid evidence.	1
2012/s/pv_6735/212:1	However, the security situation remains a cause for everyone's concern, despite the decrease in the number of security-related incidents in December 2011 and January 2012, compared to the previous two months last year.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/177:1	We note that efforts to reform local government have witnessed delays.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/53:3	Violence and displacement pose a direct challenge to the credibility of the voting process.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/214:2	Combating impunity is also of great importance to prevent sexual violence.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/236:2	These actions undermine the fragile foundations of the Afghan state and hamper the achievement of long-term stability.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/103:3	At this stage of the peacebuilding process, such behavior may be misunderstood and may incite violence, which can then turn into conflict.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/86:2	The challenge now is to build on that foundation and turn the promise of peace into reality.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/256:1	South Africa has always been among the countries that have condemned all acts of violence, terrorism, indiscriminate use of force and physical destruction of property.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/318:2	This type of interaction can enable preventive action to be taken at an appropriate time.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/95:2	Terrorism poses a serious challenge to our security, to the fundamental principles of democratic societies and to the rights and freedoms of our citizens.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/176:4	But we are concerned about reports of increasing tension between the ruling parties and the opposition parties.	1
2012/s/pv_6709/136:1	The Sahel countries are making progress in their counter-terrorism capabilities.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/168:3	The mission's recommendations in this regard require serious study.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/220:2	It is absolutely necessary to avoid any actions, activities or statements that could undermine or hinder peace efforts.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/177:5	Local governance reform programmes should not wait for final status negotiations.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/51:8	Elections held after a long conflict are meant to establish political legitimacy for a post-war regime.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/49:3	But, as I said in Tuesday's open session, events must be seen in context, and the Security Council will do nothing to contribute to a peaceful settlement when it condemns the actions of one side and turns a blind eye to everything else that happens in the region.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/65:1	Perhaps the greatest long-term challenges facing Timor-Leste will be social and economic.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/272:3	At the same time, Cuba condemns suicide bomb attacks and other acts against Israeli civilians, who are innocent victims of the cycle of violence driven by their government's policy. We also reject the use of these scattered actions to cast doubt on the legitimate exercise of self-defense by the Palestinian people, and to justify activities, which are widely or selectively committed against the Palestinian population.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/297:1	First, it is important to take into account two equally legitimate desires: on the one hand, there is the demand of minorities to live in security, to have the same opportunities for economic development, to have the same access to social services and education, and to exercise their right to return. ; On the other hand, there is the desire of the majority of the population to exercise its right to self-determination.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/59:1	Few Iraqi families have escaped the scourge of violence and human rights violations. Naturally, many of these families feel a deep sense of injustice.	0
1999/s/pv_3969/43:1	“The Security Council expresses its deep concern about the humanitarian impact of the conflict on the Angolan people.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/82:3	This Council should not allow that strategy to be rewarded by responding to terrorism rather than addressing terrorism itself. Rather, it should be met with rejection, not appeasement.	1
2011/s/pv_6544/51:2	In this regard, the Council condemns, in the strongest terms, the continued threats and acts of intimidation against members of the Mission.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/332:1	Let me begin by reiterating the European Union's deep concern about the situation in Somalia and the regional repercussions resulting from the conflict there.	1
2006/s/pv_5603/250:1	While we are aware of the challenges that implementation tasks will face, we believe that sustainable development cannot be achieved in the region without effective institutions based on good governance and the availability of the necessary resources that can only be available under security and stability.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:1	A major issue in post-conflict countries is security sector reform.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/214:5	They do not recognize the illegal and unilateral secession attempt by the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/340:2	However, concerns remain for the 2.3 million people still living in a crisis situation.	1
2012/s/pv_6735/130:1	However, we are concerned by recent developments, including increased tensions between members of local communities and ISAF forces.	1
2012/s/pv_6709/225:2	However, the situation remains a source of concern, given the long border between our two countries, which is difficult to control.	1
2005/s/pv_5243/46:1	I would like to draw members' attention to document S/2005/436, which contains the text of a letter dated 26 July 2005 addressed to the President of the Security Council from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/48:2	The operation went well, and was not accompanied by any major security incidents or incapacitating logistical challenges.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/62:1	The main Palestinian factions in Lebanon expressed concern about the incidents and distanced themselves from Fatah al-Islam.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/256:4	The Council must call for an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from the area.	1
2011/s/pv_6609/86:2	The limited ability within the region to track financial flows is another major challenge, especially given that illicit profits can exacerbate corruption.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/75:4	But let us be honest with each other - there is no issue in Kosovo that does not relate to the Centre, directly or indirectly.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/91:2	By thinking of taking initiatives that practically reward this strategy, the Council will only embolden the terrorists and undermine the letter and spirit of the road map.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/63:2	There is no doubt that we have underestimated the humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan. Mr. John Holmes will discuss this topic in detail.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/56:4	He refused to arrest Ali Kushayb and Ahmed Haroun.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/54:3	Throughout those difficult days and weeks, Kosovo's political leaders and citizens managed this largely exceptional situation maturely and without disruption or destabilization.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/290:1	Moreover, we have strengthened the focus of our efforts to be more effective in Afghanistan, especially in Kandahar Province.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/129:3	Here in the Security Council, there are three situations in particular that require our attention today.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/88:6	A one-state solution may satisfy many basic Palestinian desires, but it does not satisfy the Israelis' essential requirement to maintain their self-determination and sovereignty.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/102:1	This situation continues even as the Libyan authorities do not have any opportunity to fully control the situation in their own country or to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist elements.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/118:2	The Palestinians must end public incitement to violence and do everything in their power to prevent extremists from attacking Israel, provoking an Israeli response.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/60:1	We are confident that these groups will not be able to undermine the electoral process at the national level.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/71:2	I spent four days in Afghanistan at the end of June assessing the humanitarian situation, given growing concerns about the difficult humanitarian situation and the issue of the protection of civilians.	1
2004/s/pv_5077/56:1	The Palestinians feel that the struggle is a battle of resistance that they wage every day for their identity and to prevent the disappearance of the possibility of having a future as a people.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/127:1	The situation on the ground is also worrying from a humanitarian standpoint. The Secretary-General stresses that Iraq is going through a major crisis, and stated that the situation is deteriorating.	1
2004/s/pv_5024/66:6	Although the official training period for the reserve unit officially ended on August 23, it is estimated that at least three additional months of intensive training and on-the-job supervision will be required.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/72:1	At the same time, Germany and the European Union have repeatedly in the past condemned terrorist crimes that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis.	1
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/87:3	Sustainable and effective democratic governance is a goal that must be pursued with great resolve, and even with a sense of what the situation requires, and that rapid action is needed everywhere, and Haiti is no exception.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/73:4	There is no doubt that the structure and development of public administration in Timor-Leste remains an important challenge that must be taken into account.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/273:3	This is what makes the Iranian leadership's irresponsible threatening rhetoric even more disturbing.	1
2011/s/pv_6495/53:4	It must maintain its independence and objectivity in order to instill confidence in the electoral process.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/61:1	Under international law, Israel is obligated, as the occupying state, to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, and is obligated to preserve civilian property.	1
2012/s/pv_6735/63:2	Improving this situation requires the enforcement of laws - in particular the law on the elimination of violence against women - that criminalize and punish violence and harmful practices against women and girls.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/65:1	Last Sunday, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of the Hamas movement, Hamas leader Haniyeh refused to allow President Abbas to remain in office until the internal division was resolved.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/337:1	As long as we are discussing the development challenges facing Afghanistan, the recent incident justifies the bleak picture regarding the security situation.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/224:4	In this context, the European Union reminds Israel of its commitment to ensuring full and safe access to humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/183:1	Although a senior official in the Provisional Institutions of Kosovo and Metohija recently tried to explain this failure by citing high unemployment rates, the facts point in another direction.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/312:2	Therefore, another serious challenge in the near future will be to build a sustainable economy fueled by a culture of democratic and transparent governance that creates jobs and helps achieve the state's core social missions.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/426:1	We consider Armenia's position an open and direct challenge to the conflict resolution process and a serious threat to international and regional peace and security.	1
2012/s/pv_6709/191:1	The Togolese delegation believes that all these issues require urgent action to prevent the Sahel region from falling into complete insecurity, which would be very detrimental to its development.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/111:1	At the same time, other essential elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by increasing the effectiveness, integrity and overall performance of the judiciary, and strengthening law enforcement institutions with a view to reducing organized crime and ethnic violence and bringing all criminals to justice.	1
2004/s/pv_4934/98:2	This will require a clear position, especially, frankly, from the United States of America.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/108:2	We address these challenges in democratic and effective ways.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/265:3	It is clear that continued international assistance is required, and as the Secretary-General noted in his report,	0
2011/s/pv_6548/50:1	Meanwhile, President Bashir threatens the international community with revenge, and thus more crimes.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/117:1	In the current situation, which is an extremely difficult situation, we call on both Israelis and Palestinians to prevent escalation of the conflict and to begin implementing their obligations under the road map, in order to revive the prospects for peace.	1
2008/s/pv_5855/188:8	We now have a better understanding of the scale of the challenges that we could previously only guess at.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/52:2	If these matters are resolved in favor of the Public Prosecutor, the two defendants will plead guilty to the charges against them.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/115:2	He added that the incident would undermine peace, security and stability in the country.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/212:2	Despite these challenges, we cannot fail to acknowledge that approximately 50 percent of the Afghan people live in areas where responsibility for security has been transferred to the Afghan security forces.	1
2007/s/pv_5693/211:1	The humanitarian consequences of continuing violence in Iraq are a source of grave concern to my delegation.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/145:2	Minorities, especially the Serb minority, have a fundamental duty to fully engage in the search for solutions by taking advantage of all available opportunities to participate in Kosovo's institutions.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/229:3	It is time for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most basic rights of the Palestinian people, and to break the vicious cycle of violence resulting from Israel's continuing and ongoing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/326:1	Brazil is also convinced that a stable Somalia requires the development of a comprehensive strategy that combines security and development.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/110:2	All of this requires waging a powerful war against entrenched informal actors, whose presence poses a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of its sovereignty by the Afghan state.	1
2008/s/pv_5855/333:7	We are disappointed, Mr. President, that despite your efforts and the efforts of many others, the Council was unable to condemn that brutal terrorist attack.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/174:4	But despite these achievements, challenges to the government's authority and effective control over its national territory still need to be overcome.	1
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/408:3	It is also indisputable that Armenia, as the occupying power, bears direct responsibility for the commission of these crimes.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/295:1	In order to achieve more significant and robust progress, the international community should act in a more coherent and determined manner to establish the necessary basic framework.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/64:1	The political deadlock within the Transitional Federal Parliament poses another challenge.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/171:2	In that context, we remain concerned about the most vulnerable groups in Timor-Leste: the poor and the displaced.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/84:4	It is part of a mantra that is constantly repeated before this Council, and the repetition does not make it more true. It ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights, and does not acknowledge the excessive difficulties faced by Israeli forces in trying to protect their citizens and minimize harm to Palestinian lives while terrorists do not Those you face care more about the lives of Palestinians than they care about the lives of Israelis.	1
2007/s/pv_5788/68:3	We note the security concerns that Israel says force it to continue its aircraft flights, especially allegations of violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to Resolution 1701 (2006).	1
2008/s/pv_6049/229:4	Today I will only emphasize the following four points.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/74:5	The lack of land and jobs, as well as insecurity, prevent many returnees from settling in their communities of origin.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/154:2	The German government strongly condemns these acts of violence.	1
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/404:1	Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan) (spoke in English): First of all, I would like to apologize for asking for the floor again, as we considered it inappropriate and counterproductive to ignore the comments made by the representative of Armenia and his attempt to mislead the Security Council into remaining silent about them.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/239:1	The ongoing plight and suffering of the Palestinian people remains a tragic embodiment of the consequences of the refusal to implement Security Council resolutions and the failure of the Security Council to enforce its resolutions.	1
2008/s/pv_5919/36:1	The session opened at 10:18.	0
2007/s/pv_5788/54:2	Early this month, Prime Minister Fayyad circulated a summary of the Palestinian reform and development plan for the period 2008-2010.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/112:2	This political incident was strongly denounced through a press release issued by the office of President Ernest Bai Kroma, as well as by numerous press releases issued by political interest groups, including the APC, the People's Movement for Democratic Change and the Independent Commission for the Media. The Political Parties Registration Committee and the Good Governance Campaign.	1
2006/s/pv_5603/152:4	We could go on to mention widespread poverty, problems in natural resource management, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, thousands more former combatants awaiting reintegration, unreformed security sectors, extensive human rights violations, and many other threats that are likely to fueling a new conflict.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/89:2	In that regard, we believe that destructive action aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be absolutely condemned.	1
2010/s/pv_6353/91:1	While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemn the incident and demand the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has claimed that the other side is responsible for provoking the incident.	1
2010/s/pv_6353/161:3	We would also like to express our concern that the return of these incidents could lead to an unstable situation in the region, making it difficult to achieve a peaceful solution to the Kosovo situation that is acceptable to both parties.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/75:3	Israel must also refrain from taking unilateral actions in Jerusalem that would change the status quo or undermine confidence.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/205:2	Combined with fanaticism and deep roots in the political and social life of the region, organized crime threatens the very foundation of principles and values ​​that we are trying to instill in the new institutions formed there, and thus our efforts are in vain.	1
2010/s/pv_6259/58:5	As a result, the security threats to many countries in Africa and beyond, including member states of this Council, have been crossed, exposing their vulnerabilities.	1
2011/s/pv_6495/59:1	In addition to the humanitarian challenges, the situation raises security concerns.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/201:2	As we have always emphasized, that position does not involve pre-judging the essence of the issue; Rather, it is a firm call to give both justice and the political process a chance.	0
2004/s/pv_4952/90:4	But accomplishing the mission is not impossible if we set realistic goals based on principles and move forward towards them with deliberate steps, and if we have the support of others and are not alone when we take those steps.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/202:1	As a measure to optimize the use of the Council's time and to allow as many delegations as possible to speak, I will not invite individual speakers to take seats at the Council table and then to return to their seats at the side of the room.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/135:3	The failure of any Member State to comply with its obligations under the Charter should have consequences, and Sudan should not be exempt from this.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/105:2	As I have stressed on numerous occasions, lasting security and stability for any country, as well as for Timor-Leste, will only be achieved in conjunction with socio-economic development.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/224:2	We believe that Somalia faces a challenge similar to that of a marathon runner, because the drafting of the constitution must be completed by 20 April and its adoption completed by 22 May.	1
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/213:3	The impunity of these high-ranking officers is unacceptable and prevents post-conflict societies from recovering sustainably.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/282:1	The Afghan authorities and the international community must make clear that this behavior is unacceptable.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/187:5	Pristina has so far rejected every initiative in this regard.	1
2012/s/pv_6735/108:3	In this regard, the measures taken to address the serious problems in the correctional system are encouraging despite the serious challenges that remain.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/69:2	Although the President acted within his constitutional powers, I discussed with him concerns regarding the possibility that the pardons issued on 25 December 2009 might reinforce the perception of impunity.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/72:1	The Arab Spring reaffirms what history warns of: that when governments respond with an iron fist to their citizens' irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands, and irrepressible hopes, they are doomed to collapse in the long term.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/52:2	The progress achieved, and I hope there is no doubt that some progress has been made, must be viewed in the context of the challenges facing Kosovo.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/250:3	First, it caused an ongoing humanitarian emergency that also threatened peace and stability in Haiti.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/259:7	Developing effective Somali judicial capacity will also enable Somalis to address the scourge of terrorism and piracy.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/308:2	It is clear that collective efforts require greater resources and a better integration process - a fact embodied in the Bucharest and Paris outcome documents.	0
2006/s/pv_5465/54:1	Therefore, Greece insists on the need to clarify the sixth preambular paragraph - urging the Council “to make progress towards the resumption of negotiations to reach a comprehensive settlement” - as it should be emphasized once again that those negotiations should take place between the two communities.	1
2010/s/pv_6259/100:1	In that regard, we would like to go further to say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to enable the Somali security forces to subdue the most powerful insurgents and enable the Government to expand its areas of authority as much as possible if peace negotiations fail.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/276:2	In his report, the Secretary-General notes some improvement measures in all of these areas except for the central issue of local government reform, in particular, decentralization, where progress is lacking.	1
2009/s/pv_6230/137:3	The Court's intervention must be a catalyst for decisive national and international action to address challenges to justice in conflict situations.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/53:1	Some concerns were expressed - not long ago by several presidential candidates - about the integrity of the recording.	1
2008/s/pv_5855/344:4	In order to continue this struggle, it is imperative that the international community make a greater contribution and pay more attention to this important aspect of the fight against terrorism.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/109:2	The long-term security and stability of Somalia will require an effective and credible judicial system.	0
2002/s/pv_4582/35:1	The session opened at 3 p.m.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/178:8	It is a rough road, and it requires patience and perseverance.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/189:2	My delegation strongly condemns these acts of violence and extends its condolences to the family of the deceased pediatrician.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/116:2	In return, the authorities in Belgrade must end their obstructionist approach, which prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo’s public institutions. The “vacant seat policy” entails a great risk of writing Kosovo’s history without the participation of Kosovo Serbs.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/140:2	The Haitian National Police needs sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its constitutional law enforcement duty.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/102:2	Likewise, I can see the need for the international community to direct its attention and resources to other hotspots of tension around the world.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/101:1	We are particularly concerned about the indiscriminate proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond its borders as a result of the conflict.	1
2008/s/pv_5855/158:3	This would truly demonstrate the global nature of the United Nations' counter-terrorism efforts and the fact that Member States are united.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/105:4	This is a complex challenge for Sahel countries and regional agencies.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/76:2	We urge Israel to take further action to remove outposts in accordance with the Roadmap, and to address the growing threat posed by settler extremism.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/161:2	A larger UN presence is indeed vital, but for the added value of our organization to be fully effective, adequate funds must be provided for both staff and security. Mr. Eide reminded us of this a few moments ago.	1
2010/s/pv_6297/77:1	As for the military aspects of security sector reform, the government has made clear that it wants to rely largely on bilateral aid to build the military's capabilities.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/286:4	In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the continued lack of progress in the areas of freedom of movement of minorities, sustainable returns and relevant representation of minorities in government structures and in the public sector at large.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/184:1	My Government acknowledges the many expressions of condemnation and outrage that have resulted from this terrible incident. We particularly appreciate the Security Council's quick reaction to this heinous crime.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/238:4	In fact, given the history of foreign intervention, such directives would not only be questioned by various sectors of society but could also exacerbate the problem.	1
2010/s/pv_6353/136:1	Above all, our concerns were related to the insistence of the Pristina authorities to implement the so-called strategy for northern Kosovo in flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which remains the main international legal framework for reaching a settlement in Kosovo.	1
2005/s/pv_5336/44:1	The members of the Council have before them document S/2005/745, which contains the text of a letter dated 7 December 2005 addressed to the President of the Security Council from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) on Liberia transmitting the report of the Group of Experts on Liberia.	0

2012/s/pv_6729/157:3	The conference also reminded us of the difficult challenges that lie ahead.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/86:3	This disturbing pattern of activities is a serious concern that threatens to undermine the credibility of United Nations operations.	1

2010/s/pv_6259/53:2	It is no longer possible to ignore the crisis, which has become a more difficult challenge today than ever before.	0

2008/s/pv_6049/308:1	We express our deep concern about the plight of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/44:3	In Egypt, we have been calling for the early and peaceful transfer of power to a civilian government.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/144:3	The situation of minorities remains a cause for concern, especially with regard to freedom of movement and access to justice.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/219:1	We, once again, condemn the killing of civilians, whether by the Palestinian or the Israeli side.	1

2011/s/pv_6495/73:1	One thing that remains a major concern of mine is that the efforts that Liberians are making to rebuild their judicial system will take a long time, so the system itself is likely to remain weak and vulnerable in the short term.	1

2011/s/pv_6609/96:1	We took note of the concern regarding the implementation of the joint statement of 2 April 2009, which was referred to in the report.	1

2004/s/pv_5025/320:2	As the United Nations Support Mission in Afghanistan, we would be irresponsible if we did not appeal to the international community, the Government of Pakistan, the Government of Afghanistan and its national forces to end that situation, especially on the southern border.	1
2006/s/pv_5492/55:3	While Hezbollah's actions are regrettable, and as I have said, Israel has the right to defend itself, the use of excessive force must be condemned.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/108:1	Pakistan's new democratic government has inherited a daunting legacy of political, economic and security challenges.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/234:4	Further development of the situation in this direction could threaten efforts to reform and build the country, and in the long term it would threaten peace and stability throughout the region.	1

2004/s/pv_5024/173:2	We are particularly concerned about the lack of training for mid-level civil servants, in addition to the significant problems that continue to surround the judicial field.	1
2004/s/pv_5024/98:1	The recent rulings by an Indonesian Court of Appeal, overturning four convictions by the ad hoc Human Rights Court, while outside the mandate of the Mission, have a direct impact on the larger issue of accountability for crimes.	1

2008/s/pv_6049/285:3	However, this requires an American will that places Middle East peace at the top of its priorities, overcoming the neglect and exclusion that has continued for about seven years and led to the aggravation of the situation in the region.	1
2011/s/pv_6495/48:5	However, this was not so serious as to interfere with the operation. The simplicity of logistics makes it difficult to successfully vote twice on Election Day.	0

2004/s/pv_4934/114:4	Statements such as “The Palestinian people do not love their children” or “The Palestinian people are sending their children to death because of their hatred for Israel” are statements that smack of racism and reflect the kind of approach that should be rejected outright - and I am trying to do that now.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/176:4	Sharing blame, creating scapegoats who bear responsibility for the failure in Afghanistan, and demanding that those who actually do a lot do the most unfair and unacceptable practices will ultimately lead to psychological defeat.	1
2004/s/pv_4934/108:2	We cannot send a message that terrorists will be safe and be satisfied with the usual condemnations.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/91:4	Many achievements have been achieved, but many challenges still lie ahead.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/124:5	The recent fatwa issued by the Ulema Council condemning drug and other related activities could be very helpful in thwarting opium poppy production.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/286:3	We therefore urge the members of the Council and the Group of Friends of Haiti to view positively these recommendations made by the Secretary-General.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/113:4	Peoples not only aspire to, but also demand, that more pluralistic and representative governments provide tangible benefits to their citizens.	1

2008/s/pv_5930/215:3	Now, what Afghanistan has achieved is being eroded by the serious challenges the country faces to its security and stability.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/111:1	While piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a critical challenge, we call on the international community not to lose sight of the fact that the solution to this problem must be achieved on land, not at sea. A comprehensive solution to the Somali conflict must address all the root causes of piracy and other challenges, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic waste.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/148:1	The second point I would like to highlight today is our continuing concern for the well-being of the innocent residents of Gaza and in the towns and cities of southern Israel.	1

2004/s/pv_5049/36:1	The session opened at 5 p.m	0
2004/s/pv_5077/71:1	I also remember how unacceptable it was for Israelis to talk about the 1967 borders, and for a long time it was almost inconceivable to suggest evacuating Israeli settlements.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/155:1	The Secretary-General's recent report on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) clearly expressed the importance of disarming Hezbollah and ending arms smuggling across the Lebanese-Syrian border.	1

2008/s/pv_5855/188:5	This may be due to a sense of urgency as well as to the limitations of the Council itself as an intergovernmental political body of primarily an executive nature.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/245:2	It also demands that Israel - the occupying power - adhere to the rules of international law and the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, as well as the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions.	0
