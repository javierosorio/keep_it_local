2012/s/pv_6734/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 9.50 a.m.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/108:1	As these complexities and behaviour continue, which are completely contrary to what is required for a just solution, we must ask: How can we achieve a successful conclusion to the peace process in 2009? We believe that the responsibility lies with the Quartet and the Security Council to put in place a practical mechanism to address these issues, in a situation where one party repeatedly refuses to respond to calls and fulfil its obligations, and to engage us in a periodic process without an end in sight.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/146:5	The resolution reiterates the importance of fulfilling those obligations and stresses that neither party should undertake any activity that is contrary to those obligations under the road map or prejudges final status negotiations.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/146:3	We believe that the issue of supporting the legitimacy of the Government is important because of the existence of a causal relationship, legitimacy and the removal of resistance by informal actors and networks of the nature of the force in Afghanistan.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/64:3	We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as it violates the most basic right to human rights: the right to life.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/139:1	The report of the assessment mission points to growing concern about the humanitarian and economic impact of the crisis on the Sahel region.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/67:2	The declaration of independence was rejected both at the time of its birth.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/106:1	The report mentions a number of incidents, particularly in the security sector, which are of serious concern.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/345:3	At the same time, all Somali stakeholders, in particular the Transitional Federal Institutions, must act in accordance with their promises to address the enormous political, economic and security challenges facing them.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/153:1	Viet Nam is deeply concerned about the alarming deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
2002/s/pv_4583/34:1	The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/159:4	While we are pleased that more than 10 million Afghan voters have been registered, we are concerned that there has been insufficient voter registration in the southern and south-eastern parts of Afghanistan due to security concerns.	3
1998/s/pv_3872/46:1	The meeting was called to order at 4.15 p.m.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/224:4	We are particularly disappointed at the very low number of returnees, the best indicator of the assessment of the situation in the Territory.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/97:2	As the representative of Algeria had just pointed out, the draft resolution, which had not been adopted, contained a clear condemnation of all terrorist attacks against civilians and all acts of violence and destruction.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/375:4	At times, in order to camouflage these facts, the military has been dizzying to send false messages that it is the official armed forces that are engaged in such violence.	3
2005/s/pv_5243/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10.18 a.m.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/65:6	Their responsibility is more important than their direct responsibility, but less than those of others working on a more global scale.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/76:2	We face a situation that requires urgent action.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/136:6	As emphasized in the Final Communiqué of the London Conference, these needs can be met by specialized Somali courts.	0
2005/s/pv_5202/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/132:3	We condemn the excessive use of force by the Israeli army in densely populated areas, which inflicts widespread suffering and losses on large numbers of Palestinian civilians, including children.	3
2002/s/pv_4583/45:1	"""The Security Council stresses that RCD/Goma will be held accountable for any extrajudicial executions, including among members of civil society or those held in its detention centres in Kisangani."	3
2012/s/pv_6709/190:3	Taken together, these challenges constitute political pressures on Governments and have a direct and serious impact on peace, security and stability in the countries concerned.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/270:1	In this regard, I would like to reiterate that, unlike some other known cases involving illegal and unfounded territorial claims, including under the fabricated pretext of caring for ethnic minorities, the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination and statehood has been recognized.	3
2001/s/pv_4364/4:1	"""At its 4364th meeting, held behind closed doors on 5 September 2001, the Security Council considered the situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo."	0
2004/s/pv_5025/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/198:2	The impasse could increase political tensions and affect the growing atmosphere of confidence that prevailed following the elections and the inauguration of President Martelly.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/147:1	For our part, we are directly linking the issue of legality with the holding of elections in preparation under the Joint Electoral Management Body.	3
2000/s/pv_4183/4:1	"At its 4183rd meeting, held in private on 3 August 2000, the Security Council considered ""The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo."""	0
2007/s/pv_5800/46:1	"""The Security Council reaffirms its condemnation of all targeted assassinations of Lebanese leaders, particularly since October 2004, and demands an immediate end to the use of intimidation and violence against representatives of the Lebanese people and institutions."	3
2004/s/pv_5049/270:2	The Cuban delegation strongly condemns the attacks against Palestinian civilians and the general destruction caused by the Israeli occupying forces in the northern Gaza Strip, and we also call for an immediate end to those attacks and the urgent withdrawal of the occupying forces.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/75:3	At this moment, Qassam rocket fire continues to be deliberately directed from Gaza against the civilian population, targeting innocent civilians and terrorizing them while sleeping in their tricksters, sitting in their living rooms, or taking their children to school.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/69:3	I would also like to reiterate that the four members of the Armed Forces of Timor-Leste convicted of manslaughter in a shooting in which eight members of the National Police of Timor-Leste were killed in 2006, one of whom was pardoned and three of whom benefited from reduced sentences, have not yet paid the compensation ordered by the Court to the widows of the victims.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/275:2	These positions are an indirect participation in the blinding of the positions of the Syrian Government on its territory and an irresponsible incitement to violence in all its forms, which would provide international cover for terrorist acts by armed groups against the interests of Syria and its people and Government.	3
2011/s/pv_6490/50:1	Let us speak frankly: these reports from the press, human rights groups and civilians on the ground raise serious concerns about the nature and scope of the conflict.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/171:2	The leaders of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government usually evade their responsibilities under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/200:1	One of those concerns must be highlighted, namely, the deterioration of the security situation in recent weeks and months.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/53:2	I must inform you with deep concern once again today that despite the considerable efforts of UNAMID, the security situation in Darfur has not improved significantly.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/131:2	The social and economic challenges facing Afghanistan are significant.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/55:3	These regulations cover the financing of the campaign, electoral activities, public order, access to the media and misuse of government resources for political purposes.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/164:1	Finally, the broad institutional, cultural, ethnic and spiritual diversity of societies that are currently undergoing profound historical change may lead to certain security tensions and concerns.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/302:4	There is a real awareness of the challenges faced by each individual country.	3
2007/s/pv_5738/37:1	The meeting was called to order at 12.45 p.m.	0
2001/s/pv_4300/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 1.20 p.m.	0
2005/s/pv_5240/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 5.10 p.m.	0
2007/s/pv_5716/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/119:1	"""The rivalry between opposing political forces casts doubt on the country's recent democratic success and threatens its progress towards lasting stability"" (S/2011/540, para."	3
2008/s/pv_5930/308:1	In conclusion, the challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous, but we are making progress.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/123:2	We are concerned about the deterioration of the living standards of the people as a result of the difficulties faced by the country in 2008, particularly as a result of the global food crisis and the damage caused by the hurricanes that struck the island.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/255:1	But there was also concern that only a flash of hope in the Middle East and an escalation of violence and destruction were brought to bear.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/99:2	I would like to stress, in particular, as indicated in the report, that the Taliban continue to pose a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and that the containment of that organization is crucial.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/124:1	However, Afghanistan continues to face challenges in its quest for stability and development, and key challenges include the security situation, the worsening humanitarian situation, challenges related to the rule of law, human rights and continued violence, resulting in increased civilian casualties.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/289:1	Fourthly, piracy off the coast of Somalia is an international problem that requires our collective efforts and contributions.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/144:2	The Secretary-General cautions unequivocally that none of the eight standards have yet been fully met.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/72:2	We strongly condemn this morning &apos; s brutal attack on the Imams Ali al-Hadi and Hassan &apos; s military mosque in Samarra, and we share the Iraqi people &apos; s anger at that crime. It is yet another deliberate attempt by terrorists to sow the seeds of discord and fuel sectarian conflict among the Iraqi people.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/57:6	This means that separatists continue to blatantly flout international law and reject the universal principles of the Charter of the United Nations.	3
2006/s/pv_5466/50:3	We stressed the tragic effects of such messages recently on other parts of the continent.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/77:3	But there can be no mistake that my country is also prepared to resist its ever-lost declaration of independence, as long as a settlement is not on the horizon.	3
2011/s/pv_6566/47:2	As at 23 June, more than 1.1 million people had crossed the Libyan border into Tunisia, Egypt, Niger, Algeria, Chad and the Sudan.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/67:4	To date, there has been no improvement in the management of reform at the national level.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/171:1	We raise the issue of violence in order to express our impatience with regard to finding satisfactory and urgent solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/65:1	I am concerned that this parliamentary vote and the stalemate within Parliament could waste the gains made by Somali stakeholders and their partners with great difficulty.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/75:5	In all those discussions, I am encouraged that I have discovered a convergence of views: we all wonder how much Liberia has accomplished since the end of the fighting in 2003, but everyone is fully aware of the magnitude of the challenges that Liberia continues to face, and that we are taking nothing as a last resort.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/98:4	Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian ad hoc court process, additional remedial measures may be required to achieve justice.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/61:4	This is unacceptable and even contradicts the declared ban by anti-Government forces on the use of landmines.	3
2011/s/pv_6490/49:2	In their public statements, Colonel Gaddafi and his family continued to threaten citizens with civil war and with the possibility of mass massacres if protests continued.	3
2010/s/pv_6444/52:2	The Council condemns all attacks by local and foreign armed groups that threaten the population, peace and stability of the Central African Republic and the subregion, including the attacks on Birao by the Rassemblement des patriotes pour la justice et la paix on 19 July and 24 November.	3
2006/s/pv_5492/42:1	The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel &apos; s withdrawal from Lebanon -- which this Council ratified six years ago -- would bring security along its northern borders, found themselves exposed to ongoing rocket attacks by Hizbullah, which, day after day, reached even deeper within Israel &apos; s territory.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/228:5	Attacks against national and international security forces, personnel of public institutions, humanitarian workers and representatives of States have increased, attacks against polling sites and threats against voter registration teams have increased.	3
2009/s/pv_6111/60:4	This was illustrated by recent incidents of indiscipline in DIS, in particular the alleged killing of a civilian by a DIS commander in Farchana on 22 March.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/309:2	We note that the continuing challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/137:1	At the same time, my delegation believes that elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, in particular Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their voters if they took a more participatory approach, rather than withdrawing from the Assembly whenever they faced a difficult situation.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/229:2	We should not underestimate the threat posed by the destabilizing activities of Al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/57:2	While neither side seems ready to return to war, there is a disturbing pattern of escalation and destabilization that could lead to a widespread confrontation that could endanger the lives of more civilians.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/140:2	However, the situation within Kosovo today continues to be of concern to us.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/179:1	Like the other speakers who spoke before us, and in line with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the work that led to the death of Mr. Dzikovic and the wounding of several others during the protests in northern Mitrovica on 2 July.	3
2007/s/pv_5718/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 11.25 a.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/151:1	We urge Israel to stop its military incursions into Gaza.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/124:3	South Africa stresses that, given the magnitude of these challenges, a comprehensive strategy that includes security, humanitarian efforts, good governance and socio-economic development is required.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/56:1	Recent developments in the region underscore the concerns that have long been expressed to the mission by its interlocutors.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/199:1	We also note that the escalation of violence forces the entire population of regions to flee from violence.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/186:2	Such acts are totally unacceptable and the Palestinian Authority must put an end to such attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/252:1	Through our previous discussions, Belgium shared the concern expressed by the Secretary-General at the threat posed by violence in Iraq to a society, institutions and political process in a state of vulnerability to date.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/138:2	We call on the Palestinian Authority to do everything in its power to stop those attacks.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/216:1	In conclusion, despite the significant progress that Timor-Leste has made, it continues to face many serious challenges in its quest for a stable democracy and the development of its economy.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/252:5	The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees of its security as a State.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/187:2	Clearly, this was because the said States rejected his actions.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/387:2	It is important that women, who are the first victims of violence in all its manifestations, be given a key role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, which is most important and urgent, to do so in the conflict prevention process.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/52:4	However, challenges remain in achieving lasting peace and stability in Darfur.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/171:4	These actions are being taken despite the clear negative attitude taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and are a challenge to the United Nations and the Security Council.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/124:2	The alarming drug situation required further action.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/233:1	The challenge is to ensure that our anger translates into concrete and meaningful action, with measurable early results.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/254:4	Rather, they insist on treating the case as a secondary immigration offence.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/97:2	I also say today what I said on 31 January (see S/PV.6710). It is unacceptable that the Council be prevented from assuming its responsibilities.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/168:2	His mission represents the last opportunity to prevent Syria from slipping into a civil war cycle.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/353:5	Despite the repeated condemnation of those inhumane acts by Security Council resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), which have become the source of hope for millions of victims of women and girls worldwide.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/66:5	The second reason is once again to call upon the Security Council to take urgent and necessary action to stop the bloodshed in Syria.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/273:1	In the face of this blatant threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without resorting to the double standards that have characterized its previous work in this regard, so that it can urgently and decisively adopt the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the members of the Arab Group.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/40:1	The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to remind all speakers, as I indicated in the morning meeting, to limit their statements to no more than five minutes, so that the Council can complete its work expeditiously.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/324:2	In our view, cross-border infiltration is not the primary cause of extremist violence in Afghanistan, including in the south and south-east.	0
2010/s/pv_6431/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 4.10 p.m.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/253:1	Despite the difficulties we face in reading the report before us, it identifies the challenges facing us.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/291:1	In conclusion, in the context of peace in the world and the Middle East, I would like to stress that, while we understand all the emerging security needs, it would be better for that region and the world as a whole if the situation in Iran were to be stopped from moving towards conflict because it would be the kind of conflict that would have a very unfortunate impact on the world, as it would be the last straw that would cauterize the camel with regard to world peace.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/153:1	We are deeply concerned about the fact that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated unilaterally against the other side, despite the clear expression of disgust by the international community and the Security Council about that situation.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/176:3	It also appears that a small number of logistical requirements must be met in order to complete the handover process.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/317:3	Given its current political status, Kosovo is still far from foreign direct investment and lacks the capacity to benefit from programmes and assistance of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which will have a direct impact on the establishment of a stable and effective economy.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/215:4	This is an important step in the right direction.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/56:3	Tensions along the border may turn into serious violence during the migration period in the Abyei Area, from which neither side has withdrawn completely.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/97:3	This will require more robust measures with regard to the expulsion of those who, through threats of violence, illegally use Serb property.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/71:2	The first is that human rights and freedom claims are universal and will in and of themselves be clouded over time, because they are fundamental human aspirations.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/195:7	We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to comply with the commitment contained in resolution 2036 (2012) to ban trade in Somali charcoal, particularly by those most active in this trade.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/172:6	Israel has legitimate security concerns, but those concerns can only be fully and effectively addressed through a negotiated settlement.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/230:1	At the same time, we are concerned by the observation in the report that the work on the demarcation of the land boundary between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is not proceeding quickly.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/65:2	That is important to strengthen the Mission &apos; s capacity to provide genuine protection to the Congolese civilian population, who, as Mr. Doss emphasized, have been the victims of a clear humanitarian disaster and widespread violations of human rights, in particular acts of violence directed against women and children.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/185:1	The United Kingdom knows, perhaps better than others around this table, given our role as a leading nation, how great another long-term challenge is the fight against drugs.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/114:2	Therefore, I have focused more on opportunities than on challenges in my statement.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/220:1	Actions that might diminish confidence in the outcome of the negotiations must cease or be detrimental to them, and must be reversed.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/219:4	The blockade must be lifted immediately to allow the civilian population of Gaza access to water, labour, trade, medical care and education - that is, access to their basic needs.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/263:1	I should like to remind speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to complete its work expeditiously.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/218:1	My delegation remains concerned about the continuing deterioration of the security situation in Iraq.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/151:3	We must reject any attempts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/92:3	Consequently, terrorists have failed to achieve their strategic objective of preventing large numbers of volunteers from participating in the reconstruction of the country.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/135:3	We were prevented from even condemning the violence and supporting a peaceful plan developed by Syria's neighbours.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/93:1	The intensification of the discourse on both sides, the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan, is a matter of grave concern.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/247:1	Once again, Egypt calls for an immediate cessation of Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/246:3	It clarifies issues that require attention and concludes - with the encouragement of Somali women - that the international community should raise gender equality issues, including with Somali leaders.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/185:1	Despite overall progress, it must be noted that poverty and unemployment remain a formidable challenge, as Ms. Amira Haq emphasized.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/255:2	We are deeply concerned that the ad hoc process developed for this purpose has failed.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/51:2	However, the challenges involved would be much greater, as they would be one-day events, and logistics would be complicated by the heavy rainy season in Liberia.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/252:2	However, Chad &apos; s experience has left a strong mark on European peacekeepers and has increased our awareness of the challenge facing the United Nations in that regard.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/111:4	Combating this scourge requires strengthening our criminal prosecution capacity, our judicial system, our civilian police and even our prison system.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/257:2	We have noted with concern the Secretary-General &apos; s assessment that many of the factors that triggered the 2006 crisis remain in society, making it vulnerable to instability.	3
2011/s/pv_6490/42:1	We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d &apos; Ivoire, as the Council may have witnessed in my statement earlier today.	3
2002/s/pv_4583/45:2	It also affirms that Rwanda must use its strong influence to ensure that RCD does not take such action.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/68:1	The capacity of national security forces to respond to these threats in remote areas remains limited owing to capacity constraints.	0
2012/s/pv_6708/46:4	Important security and national reconciliation challenges and issues that, in my view, require the political attention of the Council should not be underestimated.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/260:2	In accordance with these resolutions, this organ must demand that the United States Government immediately sentence Luis Posada Carriles for terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which has been prosecuted for years by its judicial system.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/154:2	Further efforts must be made by the Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations in the area of preventive activities, such as the provision of sanitation and clean water.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/46:1	"""The Council expresses deep concern at reports of an unusual and sudden influx of thousands of Misseriya to Abyei town and surrounding areas, which could bring about significant changes in the ethnic fabric of the region."	3
2008/s/pv_5930/361:2	We must now accelerate action to implement our mutual commitments.	0
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/137:2	The European Union truly believes that strong socio-economic development is required to maintain and consolidate nascent stability.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/216:1	Whatever their own capabilities, no State in our region can cope alone with the challenges of terrorism, secession and development and win the stakes of openness and democracy.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/251:3	The Mission &apos; s requirements related to resolution 1325 (2001) were more specific and detailed during the deployment of EUFOR than the subsequent deployment of EUFOR.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/143:1	To the extent that it is serious and condemnable, it is an isolated incident.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/135:2	Conflicts have complex root causes, including multiple factors, including political differences, unequal distribution of economic resources and tribal clashes, and the prospect of renewed and prolonged conflict persists, and peace will continue to require vigorous efforts by all parties.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/174:2	All concerned must ensure that Kosovo is a place of ethnic tolerance and pluralism for communities to enjoy peaceful coexistence.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/64:3	I believe that the combination of his assumption of this role with Ambassador Jurica's chairmanship of the Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee has created new vitality in our work against terrorism.	0
2012/s/pv_6708/48:1	The holding of legislative elections without delay and in a relatively peaceful atmosphere is, in our view, a major achievement that represents a major step forward in the restoration of constitutional order, more inclusive governance and the completion of the remaining key aspects of the peace process.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/177:2	The peoples of the entire world claim universal human rights.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/191:2	In this regard, the recommendations made by the assessment team to prevent the spread of conflicts, to destabilize States and to exacerbate humanitarian problems deserve close attention.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/159:1	We urge Israel to abide by its obligations with regard to the population in the occupied territories.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/330:1	In a post-conflict environment, the challenges facing women remain enormous.	0
2010/s/pv_6259/68:3	However, failure to intervene effectively to restore stability in that country is indeed threatening the effectiveness of the international community as well as the enormous resources it costs.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/140:1	Despite all efforts to restore peace and security, we remain concerned about the recent major setbacks in stabilization efforts in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/82:4	Furthermore, Chile believes that operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution contains only a condemnation of suicide attacks against civilians.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/109:1	The Republic of South Sudan is deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the border areas of both the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/200:1	"""The Council notes with concern the challenges in the area of social and economic development, as there is a marked deterioration in the living standards of the vast majority of Haitians."	3
2003/s/pv_4770/113:3	We believe that there are significant achievements and encouraging signs in this direction.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/151:4	This is an international obligation that States must fulfil to ensure justice for the victims of these reprehensible acts.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/103:1	He informed Council members that all necessary steps had been taken to apprehend the perpetrators as soon as possible and would continue to be taken.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/60:2	Not only is the electoral timetable clearly visible, but the situation along Liberia &apos; s borders with Côte d &apos; Ivoire requires close monitoring of possible security implications.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/234:1	In this regard, although the fight against terrorism is being addressed more seriously by the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular, there is limited evidence of genuine joint efforts to create a greater international response to terrorism.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/55:1	We know that conflict situations are usually characterized by the breakdown of law and order.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/224:3	Our main concern in that regard is the fact that, for the report, none of the eight key standards has yet been fully implemented.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/111:1	Afghanistan will face critical challenges in the coming months.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/34:1	The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo	0
2009/s/pv_6234/43:1	"""The Security Council notes with deep concern the postponement of the first round of the presidential elections, which were scheduled for 29 November 2009 in accordance with the communiqué issued by the Permanent Consultative Framework of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement on 18 May 2009, which was endorsed by all Ivorian political actors."	3
2012/s/pv_6729/122:2	Monitoring and identification of violations of the arms embargo and, where appropriate, targeted sanctions must be strengthened in order to reduce the potential destructive effects of that process in the Somali context.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/298:3	Timor-Leste has taken important steps towards addressing its difficult legacy, but significant and pressing challenges remain.	0
2010/s/pv_6259/66:4	The protection of civilians is a duty that has long been ignored in Somalia.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/64:3	The dissident group of parliamentarians rejected the Garowe process and put forward a proposal for the date of the presidential election from July to 30 April this year.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/73:1	The overall challenge is to take, intensify and transform the progressive steps that have been implemented.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/134:1	First, let me stress the importance of building on the current negotiations, including the Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Syrian tracks.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/239:5	However, it is unacceptable that Israel invokes its legitimate security concerns as justification for imposing measures that affect an entire people in an indiscriminate manner and in violation of international humanitarian law.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/252:3	However, we are concerned that the main factor in decision-making is being undermined by a lack of political consensus.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/188:3	While the leaders of the region have taken bold measures to combat this scourge, the Libyan crisis has erupted and exacerbated the situation.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:3	A gender perspective must be part of the reform and training of all security forces.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/117:1	We are concerned that the security situation remains problematic.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/158:1	The first is the drug situation in Afghanistan, which poses a serious and growing challenge not only to Afghanistan but also to the rest of the world.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/182:2	We are concerned about the lack of political freedoms there.	3
2006/s/pv_5597/80:2	In this regard, we would like to reiterate what we have said on previous occasions, namely, that the most serious challenge facing this investigation is the continued exploitation by some parties, in our region or beyond, of the investigations to jump to political conclusions that are not relevant to the requirements of the investigation and that are not based on evidence and firm evidence.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/212:1	However, the security situation remains a cause for concern for all, although the number of security-related incidents decreased in December 2011 and January 2012, compared with the previous two months.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/177:1	We note that efforts to reform local government have been delayed.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/53:3	Violence and displacement pose a direct challenge to the credibility of the polling process.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/214:2	The fight against impunity is also of great importance to prevent sexual violence.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/236:2	Those actions undermine the fragile foundations of the Afghan State and impede the achievement of long-term stability.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/103:3	At this stage of the peacebuilding process, this behaviour may be misunderstood and may incite violence, which can then turn into conflict.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/86:2	The challenge now is to build on that foundation and turn the promise of peace into reality.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/256:1	South Africa has always been among those countries that have condemned all acts of violence and terrorism, the excessive and indiscriminate use of force and the physical destruction of property.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/318:2	Such interaction could allow for timely preventive action.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/95:2	Terrorism poses a serious challenge to our security, to the fundamental principles of democratic societies and to the rights and freedoms of our citizens.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/176:4	However, we are concerned about the reports of increased tension between the ruling and opposition parties.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/136:1	The Sahelian countries are making progress in counter-terrorism capabilities.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/168:3	The Mission &apos; s recommendations in that regard require serious consideration.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/220:2	It is essential to avoid any actions, activities or statements that could undermine or impede peace efforts.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/177:5	Local government reform programmes must not wait for final status negotiations.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/51:8	Elections held in the aftermath of a long conflict are designed to establish political legitimacy for a post-war regime.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/49:3	But, as I said at the open Tuesday meeting, events must be viewed within its framework, and the Security Council will do nothing to contribute to a peaceful settlement when it condemns the actions of one of the parties and turns a blind eye to anything else that happens in the region.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/65:1	Perhaps the greatest long-term challenges facing Timor-Leste will be socio-economic.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/272:3	At the same time, Cuba condemns suicide bombings and other acts against Israeli civilians, who are innocent victims of the cycle of violence driven by their Government's policy, and we also reject the use of these sporadic acts to question the legitimate self-defence exercise of the Palestinian people and to justify the widespread or selective activities perpetrated against the Palestinian population.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/297:1	First, it is important to take into account two equally legitimate wishes: on the one hand, there is the demand of minorities to live in security, to have the same opportunities for economic development, to have the same access to social services and education and to exercise their right to return; and, on the other, there is the desire of the majority of the population to exercise their right to self-determination.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/59:1	Few Iraqi families have survived the scourge of violence and human rights violations, and it is natural that many of these families feel a deep sense of injustice.	0
1999/s/pv_3969/43:1	"""The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the humanitarian impact of the conflict on the Angolan people."	3
2004/s/pv_5049/82:3	This Council should not be allowed to reward that strategy by addressing the response to terrorism rather than terrorism itself; it must be rejected, not satisfied.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/51:2	In this regard, the Council condemns in the strongest terms the continuing threats and acts of intimidation against MONUC elements.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/332:1	Let me begin by reiterating the European Union &apos; s deep concern over the situation in Somalia and the regional repercussions of its conflict.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/250:1	While recognizing the challenges to implementation tasks, we are of the view that sustainable development in the region is not achieved without effective institutions based on good governance and the availability of the necessary resources, which can be made available only in conditions of security and stability.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:1	One of the key issues in post-conflict countries is security sector reform.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/214:5	They do not recognize the attempt at illegal and unilateral secession by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/340:2	However, concerns remain with regard to 2.3 million people still living in crisis.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/130:1	We are concerned, however, by recent developments, with further tensions between community members and ISAF forces.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/225:2	However, the situation remains a source of concern, given the long borders between our two countries, which are difficult to control.	3
2005/s/pv_5243/46:1	I wish to draw the attention of members to document S/2005/436, which contains the text of a letter dated 26 July 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/48:2	The operation was well conducted and was not accompanied by major security incidents or obstructionary logistical challenges.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/62:1	The main Palestinian factions in Lebanon expressed concern about the incidents and distanced themselves from Fatah al-Islam.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/256:4	The Council should call for an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces from the area.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/86:2	The limited capacity within the region to track financial flows is another major challenge, especially since illicit profits can exacerbate corruption.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/75:4	But let us be honest with each other - there is no question on the table in Kosovo that does not relate to status, directly or indirectly.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/91:2	By considering initiatives that are practically equivalent to that strategy, the Council will only make terrorists bold and undermine the letter and spirit of the road map.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/63:2	There is no doubt that we have underestimated the humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan, and Mr. John Holmes will address this issue in detail.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/56:4	Ali Kushayb and Ahmed Harun were refused arrest.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/54:3	Throughout those difficult days and weeks, Kosovo &apos; s political leaders and citizens managed that exceptional situation to a large extent in a mature manner and without disorder or destabilization.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/290:1	Furthermore, we have strengthened the focus of our efforts to be more effective in Afghanistan, particularly in Kandahar.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/129:3	Here in the Security Council, there are three specific situations that require our attention today.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/88:6	A one-State solution may satisfy many basic Palestinian wishes, but it does not meet the essential requirement of Israelis to preserve their self-determination and sovereignty.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/102:1	That situation continues even as the Libyan authorities have no opportunity to fully control the situation in their own country or to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist elements.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/118:2	The Palestinians must end the incitement of the public to violence and do their utmost to prevent militants from attacking Israel, thereby provoking an Israeli response.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/60:1	We are confident that these groups will not be able to undermine the electoral process at the national level.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/71:2	I spent four days in Afghanistan at the end of June to assess the humanitarian situation, given growing concerns about the difficult humanitarian situation and the issue of the protection of civilians.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/56:1	The Palestinians feel that the struggle is a battle of resistance that they fight every day for their identity and in order to prevent the possibility of having a future as a people from disappearing.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/127:1	The situation on the ground is also of humanitarian concern. The Secretary-General emphasizes that Iraq is going through a major crisis and states that the situation is deteriorating.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/66:6	Although the formal training period for the reserve unit officially ended on 23 August, it is estimated that at least three additional months of intensive on-the-job training and supervision will be required.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/72:1	At the same time, Germany and the European Union have repeatedly condemned the terrorist crimes that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis in the past.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/87:3	Sustainable and effective democratic governance is a goal that must be pursued with great determination and even a sense of the rapid movement required by the situation everywhere, and Haiti is no exception.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/73:4	There is no doubt that the structure and development of public administration in Timor-Leste remain an important challenge and must be taken into account.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/273:3	That makes the irresponsible threat speech of the Iranian leadership even more disturbing.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/53:4	It must maintain its independence and objectivity in order to instil confidence in the electoral process.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/61:1	Under international law, Israel, as the occupying Power, is obliged to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, and to preserve civilian property.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/63:2	Improving this situation requires the enforcement of laws - in particular the law on the elimination of violence against women - that criminalize and punish violence and harmful practices against women and girls.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/65:1	Last Sunday, on the occasion of the 21st anniversary of Hamas, Hamas leader Haniyah refused to remain in office until the internal division was resolved.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/337:1	As long as we are discussing the development challenges facing Afghanistan, the recent incident justifies the bleak picture of the security situation.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/224:4	In this context, the European Union reminds Israel of its obligation to ensure full and safe access for humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/183:1	Although a senior official of the Provisional Institutions in Kosovo and Metohija recently tried to explain that failure by citing high unemployment rates, the facts point to another direction.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/312:2	Therefore, another serious challenge in the near future will be to build a sustainable economy fuelled by a culture of democratic and transparent governance that creates employment and helps to achieve the basic social tasks of the State.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/426:1	We regard Armenia &apos; s position as an open and direct challenge to the conflict settlement process and a serious threat to international and regional peace and security.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/191:1	In the view of the delegation of Togo, all these issues require urgent action to prevent the Sahel from falling into total insecurity, which would be very detrimental to its development.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/111:1	At the same time, other key elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by increasing the effectiveness, integrity and overall functioning of the judiciary, strengthening law enforcement institutions to reduce organized crime and ethnic violence and bringing all criminals to justice.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/98:2	This will require a clear and, frankly, a special attitude from the United States of America.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/108:2	We are addressing those challenges democratically and effectively.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/265:3	It is clear that continued international assistance is required and, as the Secretary-General has pointed out in his report,	0
2011/s/pv_6548/50:1	At the same time, President Al-Bashir threatens the international community with vengeance and, consequently, with further crimes.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/117:1	In the current situation, which is extremely difficult, we call on Israelis and Palestinians alike to prevent the escalation of the conflict and to begin implementing their obligations under the road map, in order to revive the prospects for peace.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/188:8	We now have a better understanding of the magnitude of the challenges that we had previously been able to guess.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/52:2	If these matters are resolved in favour of the Prosecutor, the accused will plead guilty to the charges against them.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/115:2	The incident would undermine peace, security and stability in the country.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/212:2	Despite those challenges, we cannot fail to acknowledge that nearly 50 per cent of the Afghan people live in areas for which responsibility for security has been transferred to the Afghan security forces.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/211:1	The humanitarian consequences of the continued violence in Iraq are a matter of grave concern to my delegation.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/145:2	Minorities, especially the Serb minority, have a fundamental duty to be fully involved in the search for solutions by taking advantage of all opportunities to participate in Kosovo's institutions.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/229:3	The time has come for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most fundamental rights of the Palestinian people and to break the vicious cycle of violence resulting from Israel &apos; s continued illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/326:1	Brazil is also convinced that a stable Somalia requires a comprehensive strategy that combines security and development.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/110:2	All of this requires a strong war against the unarmed actors, whose presence poses a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of sovereignty by the Afghan State.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/333:7	We are disappointed, Mr. President, that despite your efforts and those of many others, the Council has not been able to condemn that brutal terrorist attack.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/174:4	Despite these achievements, however, challenges to the Government &apos; s effective authority and control over its national territory still need to be overcome.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/408:3	It is also indisputable that Armenia, as the occupying Power, bears direct responsibility for those crimes.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/295:1	In order to achieve more meaningful and robust progress, the international community should act in a more coherent manner and with greater determination to establish the necessary basic framework.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/64:1	The political stalemate within the Transitional Federal Parliament is another challenge.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/171:2	In that context, we remain concerned about the most vulnerable groups in Timor-Leste: the poor and the displaced.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/84:4	It is part of a song that is constantly being repeated before this Council and that does not increase its validity. It ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights. It does not recognize the excessive difficulties faced by Israeli forces in trying to protect their citizens and minimize the harm done to the lives of Palestinians, while the terrorists they face do not pay more attention to the lives of Palestinians than to the lives of Israelis.	3
2007/s/pv_5788/68:3	We note Israel &apos; s security concerns that it is obliged to continue its aircraft flights, in particular allegations of violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to resolution 1701 (2006).	3
2008/s/pv_6049/229:4	Today I will only emphasize the following four points.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/74:5	Lack of land and jobs, as well as insecurity, prevent many returnees from stabilizing in their communities of origin.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/154:2	The German Government strongly condemns these acts of violence.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/404:1	Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I would like to apologize for once again asking for the floor, for we felt that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to ignore the comments made by the representative of Armenia and to try to mislead the Security Council from them.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/239:1	The continuing plight and suffering of the Palestinian people continue to be a tragic reflection of the consequences of the refusal to implement Security Council resolutions and the failure of the Security Council to enforce its resolutions.	3
2008/s/pv_5919/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 6.10 p.m.	0
2007/s/pv_5788/54:2	Earlier this month, Prime Minister Fayyad circulated a summary of the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan 2008-2010.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/112:2	This political incident was strongly denounced through a press release issued by the office of President Ernest Bai Koroma, as well as by numerous press statements issued by political interest groups, including the General People &apos; s Congress, the People &apos; s Movement for Democratic Change, the Independent Media Commission, the Political Parties Registration Commission and the Good Governance Campaign.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/152:4	We can go on to mention widespread poverty, problems in the management of natural resources, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, additional thousands of ex-combatants waiting for reintegration, unresolved security sectors, massive violations of human rights and many other threats that are likely to fuel a new conflict.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/89:2	In that regard, we believe that the destructive action aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be unequivocally condemned.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/91:1	While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side claimed that the other was responsible for provoking the incident.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/161:3	We would also like to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents could lead to an unstable situation in the region, which makes it difficult to achieve a peaceful solution to the Kosovo situation, acceptable to both parties.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/75:3	Israel must refrain from unilateral actions in Jerusalem that would alter the status quo or undermine confidence.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/205:2	In conjunction with intolerance and deep roots in the political and social life of the region, organized crime threatens the very foundation of principles and values that we are trying to instil in the new institutions that have been formed there, thus giving away our efforts.	3
2010/s/pv_6259/58:5	As a result, the cut-off limit for security threats has been exceeded for many countries in Africa and beyond, including members of this Council, exposing their weaknesses.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/59:1	Along with humanitarian challenges, the situation raises security concerns.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/201:2	As we have always emphasized, that position does not prejudge the judgement on the substance of the case; it is a firm call to give both justice and the political process a chance.	0
2004/s/pv_4952/90:4	But it is not impossible to accomplish the task if we set realistic, principled goals and move forward at a deliberate pace, if we have the support of others and are not alone when we take that step.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/202:1	As a measure to optimize the use of Council time and to allow as many delegations as possible to speak, I will not invite individual speakers to take seats at the Council table and then to return to their seats by the side of the Chamber.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/135:3	The failure of any Member State to comply with its obligations under the Charter should have consequences, and the Sudan should not be excluded.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/105:2	As I have stressed on many occasions, security and lasting stability for any country, as well as for Timor-Leste, can be achieved only in conjunction with socio-economic development.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/224:2	We believe that Somalia faces a challenge similar to that of the Marathon enemy, because the constitution must be finalized by 20 April and its adoption completed on 22 May.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/213:3	The impunity of these high-ranking officers is unacceptable and prevents societies emerging from conflict from recovering in a sustainable manner.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/282:1	The Afghan authorities and the international community must make it clear that such behaviour is unacceptable.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/187:5	Pristina has so far rejected every initiative in that regard.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/108:3	In this regard, the actions taken to address the serious problems in the corrections system are encouraging, despite the serious challenges that remain.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/69:2	Although the President acted within his constitutional powers, she discussed with him concerns that amnesty decisions of 25 December 2009 might reinforce the impression of impunity.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/72:1	The Arab Spring reaffirms what history warns of: that when Governments respond with an iron fist to the dreams of their citizens that cannot be suppressed, their legitimate demands and their hope that cannot be lost, they are governed by long-term fall.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/52:2	The progress made must be seen, and I hope that there is no doubt that some progress has been made, in the context of the challenges facing Kosovo.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/250:3	The first, caused in a continuing humanitarian emergency, also threatened peace and stability in Haiti.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/259:7	The development of an effective Somali judicial capacity will also enable Somalis to address the scourge of terrorism and piracy.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/308:2	It is clear that collective efforts require a great deal of resources and a better integration process - a fact embodied in the Bucharest and Paris outcome documents.	0
2006/s/pv_5465/54:1	"Greece therefore insists on the need to clarify the sixth preambular paragraph - urging the Council ""to make progress towards the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement"" - as it should be reiterated that such negotiations should take place between the two communities."	3
2010/s/pv_6259/100:1	In that regard, we would like to go further since then to say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to enable the Somali security forces to subdue the most notorious rebels and to enable the Government to expand its areas of authority as far as possible if peace negotiations fail.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/276:2	In his report, the Secretary-General notes some improvement measures in all those areas, with the exception of the central issue of local governance reform and, in particular, decentralization, where progress is lacking.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/137:3	The Court &apos; s intervention must be a catalyst for decisive national and international action to address the challenges of justice in conflict situations.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/53:1	Some concerns were expressed - shortly before many presidential candidates - about the integrity of registration.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/344:4	In order to continue this struggle, it is imperative that the international community make a greater contribution and pay more attention to this important aspect of the fight against terrorism.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/109:2	The long-term security and stability of Somalia will require an effective and credible judicial system.	0
2002/s/pv_4582/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 1 p.m.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/178:8	It is a rugged road, requiring patience and perseverance.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/189:2	My delegation strongly condemns those acts of violence and extends its condolences to the family of the deceased pediatrician.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/116:2	"In contrast, the authorities in Belgrade must put an end to their obstructionist attitude, which prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo's public institutions, as the ""filled seat policy"" poses significant risks to the writing of Kosovo's history without the participation of Kosovo Serbs."	3
2011/s/pv_6618/140:2	The Haitian National Police needs adequate resources to enable it to carry out its constitutional law enforcement duty.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/102:2	Similarly, I can see the need for the international community to direct its attention and resources to other hotbeds of tension throughout the world.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/101:1	We are particularly concerned about the indiscriminate proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond its borders as a result of the conflict.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/158:3	That will indeed demonstrate the universality of the counter-terrorism efforts of the United Nations and the fact that Member States are united.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/105:4	That is a complex challenge for the countries of the Sahel and regional agencies.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/76:2	We urge Israel to take further action to remove settlement outposts in accordance with the road map and to address the growing threat posed by settler extremism.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/161:2	A larger United Nations presence is indeed vital, but in order for the added value of our Organization to be fully effective, sufficient funds must be provided for both staff and security, and Mr. Eide reminded us of this a few moments ago.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/77:1	With regard to the military aspects of security sector reform, the Government indicated that it wished to rely heavily on bilateral aid for army capacity-building.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/286:4	In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the continuing lack of progress in the areas of minority freedom of movement, sustainable returns and the related representation of minorities in government structures and in the public sector as a whole.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/184:1	My Government acknowledges the many expressions of condemnation and anger that have resulted from this terrible incident, and we particularly appreciate the Security Council &apos; s swift reaction to this heinous crime.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/238:4	In fact, given the history of foreign intervention, those directives would not only be in question for different sectors of society but could also exacerbate the problem.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/136:1	Above all, our concerns related to the insistence of the Pristina authorities on implementing the so-called strategy for northern Kosovo in flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which remains the main international legal framework for a settlement in Kosovo.	3
2005/s/pv_5336/44:1	Members of the Council have before them document S/2005/745, which contains the text of a letter dated 7 December 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the report of the Panel of Experts on Liberia.	0
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/55:1	In particular, we wish to express our deep concern at the stagnation in Haiti &apos; s socio-economic development and food security.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/214:3	However, we note that without a strong justice and security sector, developing peace and stability can be threatened.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/166:1	The international community has clearly expressed its strong condemnation of those actions, through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and a group of friends in Syria, which have a large and wide participation.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/324:4	The five or six incidents in the border areas - at least those reported - occurred in places such as Nangarhar and Zabul, near the Pakistani border.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/299:6	This is a matter of great urgency, because Kenya cannot continue to bear the burden of this situation.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/92:2	Clearly, the Executive Directorate should continue its efforts to achieve those goals.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/260:4	The threat posed by terrorists, criminals and those involved in the narcotics trade to the security and stability of Afghanistan is a real phenomenon that must be constantly addressed.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/71:9	By the end of this year, we expect better law enforcement tools to be available in the area of counter-narcotics.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/354:4	We condemn all terrorist acts committed in Afghanistan, particularly the most recent one against the Indian Embassy in Kabul, and express our condolences to the Governments and peoples of the affected countries and to the families and relatives of the victims.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/103:2	The timely collection of objective, reliable and accurate information on conflict-related sexual violence is crucial to formulating the Council &apos; s responses, as well as to strengthening action to prevent sexual violence.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/124:4	The genuine establishment of the rule of law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo requires the formation of an army and the establishment of an effective and democratic justice system and police force.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/241:1	The international community, including through the auspices of the United Nations, should use diplomatic influence and provide technical assistance in such areas as political, security and justice sector reforms, the drafting of new constitutions, legal frameworks and electoral institutions and the holding of elections.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/154:1	The continuing instability in the Sahel region has implications that go beyond the countries most directly affected.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/68:5	It calls for adherence to international law and for all parties to implement their commitments and the road map in order to realize the vision of two States living side by side in peace and security.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/227:4	We cannot risk wasting human and financial investment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo because of the frustration of citizens, which could eventually lead to a renewed crisis.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/187:4	It would be an oversight by the Board not to use such tools if the need arose.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/276:2	In the context of those conditions of massive disparities and political, economic and social marginalization, a process has emerged that seeks to change the prevailing system, seek to bring about economic and political changes and create alternatives that allow participation and open new spaces and means of expression, including in short demands on fundamental rights.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/241:1	ISAF troops must fully implement their mandate with a view to eliminating the threats emanating from Afghanistan.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/165:1	In the view of my delegation, in order to prevent the outbreak of new violence and to stabilize northern Kosovo, it remains essential that the reconciliation process be accompanied by policies aimed at ensuring the social and economic stability of the communities in a non-discriminatory manner.	3
2011/s/pv_6662/49:3	The withholding of this level of funding will paralyse any Government, let alone an occupying Power. If these funds are not released immediately, this measure will threaten the State-building gains made by the Palestinian Authority, including the promotion of good governance for the benefit of the Palestinian people and the development of security forces that maintain law and order in the West Bank.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/54:2	As members of the Security Council know better than anyone, the Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the greatest permanent diplomatic challenges the world has faced since the mid-20th century. At the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a conflict between competing and contradictory historical accounts and collective aspirations and identities.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/160:1	Mr. Le Long Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a source of concern shared by all States Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/116:8	This, of course, has led to growing popular concern and to some questioning the excessive reliance on the military option.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/232:2	However, the grave danger remains that, as a result of that decision - which violates the documents of the Bonn and Berlin Conferences - the country will face an explosive situation fraught with new armed resistance and internal divisions in power structures.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/265:1	Finding a starting point for discussions on the forthcoming challenges that the societies of the Middle East have found themselves facing and extrapolating the promising opportunities arising from these challenges can be a daunting task.	0
2006/s/pv_5603/251:1	Addressing the root causes of economic deficits requires the establishment of lasting enterprises based on sound trade and economic foundations, especially since the region has a distinct strategic position on the African continent and enormous natural wealth.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/284:7	They do all of these things, and they then seek protection and security and put it as a mask for blackmail and further concessions.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/57:1	Since the issuance of the report, there has been a significant increase in the focus on Liberia's borders with Côte d'Ivoire.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/265:1	In assessing that progress, it is important to recognize the great strides that Timor-Leste has made in a few years since independence, but equally important to recognize the great challenges that remain on the road.	0
2007/s/pv_5788/58:1	I would also like to emphasize effective Arab diplomacy in the lead-up to the Conference.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/145:2	Preventing illegal border crossing is vital in addressing terrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling.	3
2004/s/pv_4952/69:5	There are certainly people who feel uneasy about what they see as an excessive and, indeed, negative preoccupation with the communal balance.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/59:3	Although some 80 per cent of Afghans depend directly on agriculture for their livelihood, a small part of our efforts have invested in this sector.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/129:2	Unless the Government addresses these issues, they can pose serious threats to the security and stability of Timor-Leste.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/87:2	However, prevention would be effective only if peacekeeping operations had the resources they needed to carry out their mandate.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/271:4	The Palestinian Authority &apos; s ability to build reliable institutions and basic security facilities, with the will and capability to combat terrorism and other threats, is an essential element of the Palestinian State-building process and a legitimate aspiration on the Israeli side.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/287:1	It is clear that final progress in these areas will require further concerted efforts by the international community, Belgrade and the people of Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/66:2	Viet Nam believes that the diverse nature of violence against women and girls requires a comprehensive approach.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/275:1	Current problems in Afghanistan at the community level require a comprehensive solution, including not only military and security activities, but also political, development and economic activities.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/301:3	It is important, in our view, that the Conference clearly emphasized the importance of Afghan leadership and, ultimately, ownership of efforts to address the key challenges facing Afghanistan - security, institutional incompetence, corruption and drugs.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/171:5	In order to avoid a new wave of violence, the parties and the international community must act immediately.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/169:2	In order to restore real stability, there is a need for a comprehensive and broad approach, consisting of a wide range of legal, political and international instruments.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/208:1	We strongly condemn these practices, which constitute a flagrant violation of international conventions and humanitarian laws and norms. We call on the international community, the members of the Quartet and all the actors to intervene immediately and resolutely to compel Israel to put an end to such actions, which pose a serious threat to security and stability in the Middle East region. Violence can only result in violence, which could put the region in a spiral of difficulty.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/246:3	This is particularly true with regard to the political sphere and the security situation.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/265:2	In that regard, we are deeply concerned about the security situation in Afghanistan, which has deteriorated since last year as a result of the repressive activities of the remaining elements of the Taliban and Al-Qaida, inter-warlord disputes and the narcotics trade.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/255:3	Somali leaders must work towards an open political process for those who are willing to renounce violent opposition.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/161:1	Global terrorism remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/189:4	The demands of UNMIK and KFOR for information were met with a standard response from the KPC Commander, who said that, under his limited powers, he could not provide additional information.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/55:1	I would like to say something briefly about specific proposals in the revised organizational plan and how these proposals address those concerns.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/255:2	It was important to present the image and acceptance of the police as the primary law enforcement agency in society.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/42:2	Although these contacts were constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the parties are expected to submit proposals for land and security within 90 days, have not yet taken place.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/151:4	While this is a good start, its long-term sustainability will be achieved only if the Government makes complementary efforts to address other socio-economic challenges.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/68:2	We need peace to address other formidable challenges.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/163:1	Economic issues, such as investment, are also of great concern.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/235:1	In this context, Russia is convinced of the importance of developing a comprehensive international counter-narcotics strategy in Afghanistan, including a security belt along the Afghan border.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/82:1	Sierra Leone is also experiencing a surge in investment in the extractive industry.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/69:2	Some of these countries face enormous challenges, and there will be setbacks, as well as progress in the years ahead.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/150:3	We urge the Government of Haiti to take firm action to prevent such violence and to ensure that the perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/249:1	Seven years later, the 2009 edition also noted that about 30 per cent of young people in Arab countries were unemployed, that more than 50 per cent of the population was under the age of 24 and that 51 million new jobs were needed in 2020 in order to avoid an increase in unemployment.	0
2010/s/pv_6297/58:7	These are issues to be addressed in security sector reform efforts.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/65:1	The Russian Federation once again calls upon the Israeli and Palestinian sides to exercise restraint and a high spirit of responsibility and to renounce unilateralism.	3
2009/s/pv_6111/53:1	I cannot stress enough the threat posed by the unavailability of military helicopters to the operational effectiveness of the Force.	3
2004/s/pv_4952/83:2	"Some Iraqi interlocutors raised questions about that term - ""national reconciliation"" - regarding what it entails and what it requires."	0
2009/s/pv_6236/52:4	As indicated in the report, the period under review witnessed significant achievements in the peace process and in the preparations for the 2010 elections despite some challenges.	0
2009/s/pv_6111/58:1	Beyond the MINURCAT area of responsibility, other developments are also of concern.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/110:6	Representative democracy also requires the confidence of citizens in the Governments they elect.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/165:1	Although the overall security situation has also remained calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste formally assumed full responsibility for security on 20 May, smuggling, trafficking and illegal border crossing should be seen as a cause for concern, as well as tensions related to the demonstrations that took place in Dili last July.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/126:2	The lack of such participation will prevent progress in addressing important issues of public administration and will not make any progress in improving the image of Kosovo in the minds of the international community.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/58:1	Fortunately, the options before the Iraqi people are not white and black; nor are they zero. There is a whole range of grey compromise areas that can address the basic concerns of all participants in the political process.	0
2006/s/pv_5492/59:1	Despite our assessment that achieving a complete ceasefire is difficult at this time, I continue to believe that the international community must make its position clear: the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and more credible efforts by Israel to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, while urgent efforts are being made to create conditions to halt such attacks.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/271:1	The review of the security situation contained in the Secretary-General &apos; s special report (S/2008/434) suggests that despite the tireless efforts of the Afghan people and the international community, serious challenges to peace and stability in Afghanistan remain.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/188:3	The Court &apos; s Trial Chamber &apos; s decision to issue a warrant for the arrest of a Head of State on 4 March 2009 triggered a major public reaction and set hopes for peace and stability a new setback.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/379:1	Mr. Eide: I do not think that certain questions have been asked to me, but let me make a few comments.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/154:1	We are also concerned about the re-emergence of cholera, although the mortality rate appears to be declining slowly.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/128:6	The camps have been closed, and internally displaced persons are returning to normal life, although some problems remain and require immediate response.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/121:2	Measures taken to overcome shortcomings should address both immediate needs and structural deficits.	0
2011/s/pv_6566/71:1	The President (spoke in French): I now give the floor to Ambassador José Moraes Cabral of Portugal in his capacity as Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) concerning the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/54:3	However, in 2007, following the issuance of the arrest warrants against Aaron and Cocheb, President Al-Bashir publicly refused to execute them, challenging the authority of the Security Council and saying that Aaron had done what he had ordered.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/110:2	The current political situation in Kosovo highlights facts contrary to those fundamental assertions, and we hope that they will be part of the educational process for democratic stability.	0
1999/s/pv_3969/39:3	In this context, the Council reaffirms that the main cause of the crisis in Angola is UNITA &apos; s refusal to comply with the relevant basic provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, and reiterates its request that UNITA comply with its obligations to disarm and allow the extension of government administration to the territory it controls.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/115:1	In describing that unfortunate incident, the President stressed that it was malicious and unacceptable and involved potential violence in the upcoming 2012 elections.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/191:3	As the presidential elections approach, it is more urgent and urgent that the security situation be improved.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/56:4	The MDC candidate has little or no access to the media in Zimbabwe; it is forbidden to campaign freely; and campaign buses and cars are reported to have been seized by the State, allegedly for illegal registration.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/149:1	Bosnia and Herzegovina is concerned about the current political stalemate in the formation of a new Government and the definition of a clear constitutional reform process.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/105:4	We should acknowledge our great concern about the situation in Afghanistan.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/127:3	The policy of non-tolerance of such acts by the United Nations should be emphasized, and there should be no impunity for those found guilty of such crimes.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/103:1	On several occasions, we have appealed to the Council to take action to compel Israel to cease its military attacks, to ensure the protection of the civilian population and to cease all illegal punitive measures through which it causes a humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/255:1	Cuba once again comes to the Security Council to condemn and strongly condemn the complicity of the United States Government and its absolute responsibility for the release of this person.	3
2008/s/pv_5919/62:1	Africans have clearly expressed their concerns about the situation in Zimbabwe.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/171:2	Once again, those challenges include national reconciliation, political power-sharing and the equitable distribution of natural resources, particularly oil revenues.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/100:2	Moreover, the negative impact of the crisis is also evident outside Libya &apos; s borders and not only on the African continent.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/222:1	The European Union is deeply concerned about the continuing cycle of retaliatory violence in Israel and the occupied territories.	3
2011/s/pv_6688/59:3	President Al-Bashir took diplomatic reprisals against the Kenyan decision and threatened to impose economic and commercial sanctions.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/125:2	During those hearings, the Chinese delegation has always stressed the view that the Darfur issue involves a political process, the deployment of peacekeepers, economic development, humanitarian assistance and justice, which is extremely complex and requires considerable political wisdom to find a comprehensive solution that will ensure peace and justice.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/195:4	While it has only been possible to overthrow a new leader in a few months, building such a democratic society requires more time and sacrifices.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/72:4	If that is not the case, we can see more violent divisions that can occur when people claim their rights, as there is no force to force them to abandon them.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/307:4	In that context, we believe that it is important that the Security Council pay the utmost attention to the threats posed by fundamentalist and extremist religious organizations such as the Liberation Party and urge the Council to impose severe sanctions on terrorist organizations.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/56:1	I must, with great concern, inform you of the escalation of criminal acts and attacks against United Nations and humanitarian personnel.	3
2007/s/pv_5683/68:2	In addition, Israeli air violations of the Blue Line, in direct violation of resolution 1701 (2006), continued on a regular basis.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/87:1	The Brazilian Government is closely following the efforts of the Government of Haiti to undertake institutional reforms.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/134:2	In this regard, we take note of the statements made by Kosovo &apos; s main elected representatives, who immediately condemned that crime and demanded that the perpetrators be brought to justice.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/88:1	In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I should like to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/152:2	It is up to the people and leaders of the region to resist the calls of the mob, reach compromises and build alliances, continue to trust their systems even when they lose in elections, and ultimately protect the principles and institutions that will protect them.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/284:2	We believe that Palestine will remain the greatest challenge in the Middle East.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/154:2	These relate directly to the credibility of CTED.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/217:2	The international community must therefore take the necessary action to prevent Israel from continuing its series of condemned destruction in Gaza and to affirm its rejection of all such Israeli practices, which are in violation of international law and international humanitarian law.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/154:2	Although unexpected, those changes prove an old rule of politics: lack of reform leads to revolution.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/194:5	That has been a source of constant concern to us.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/261:1	While the resolution of the six-decade Palestinian tragedy will have a significant impact on the situation in the Middle East, peace in the region also requires progress on the other pillars of the peace process.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/114:3	I have also deliberately avoided other issues that some consider necessary when discussing the Middle East, such as the need to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or the situation in Syria, since we have addressed those issues at other meetings of the Council.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/85:1	However, we also oppose and condemn extrajudicial executions.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/141:3	We condemn all ethnically motivated acts and crimes committed in Kosovo.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/136:2	However, we do not believe that sovereignty makes it imperative for the Security Council to stand still when Governments carry out massacres against their peoples, thereby threatening regional peace and security.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/149:1	No one in the region is excluded from the demands for change that we have seen.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/177:1	Security challenges from the Sahelo-Saharan region are not new.	0
2006/s/pv_5466/51:3	Here, too, we received replies that seemed to justify our concerns.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/57:1	As the Prosecutor, I will face any judicial appeal by President Al-Bashir and other accused in court.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/202:2	We should avoid the easy answers that claim that the Sahel region has always faced such challenges, while it is well known that those challenges have not in fact been of such magnitude in the past.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/53:2	Owing to increased violence, the Karni crossing was closed from 15 to 20 May and has only been reopened intermittently since then.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/282:1	The nature of the terrorist threat varies between States and regions, as does the capabilities and needs of States in the fight against terrorism.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/266:1	The international guarantors of Timor-Leste &apos; s security, the International Stabilization Force (SFOR) and the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), no longer face the challenges they faced two or three years ago.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/419:3	Azerbaijan &apos; s refusal to engage in direct negotiations with the elected representatives of Nagorny Karabakh is one of the main obstacles to resolving the conflict referred to by the representative of Azerbaijan.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/242:2	How to improve the security situation is undoubtedly the greatest challenge facing Iraq, and it will determine the future of Iraq &apos; s political, economic and social development.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/64:1	The Secretary-General and his Special Coordinator for Lebanon have issued statements strongly condemning the criminal acts of opening Islam as attacks on Lebanon &apos; s stability and sovereignty.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/182:6	The United States urges the United Nations and the Haitian National Police to redouble their efforts in vetting students.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/143:1	When dealing with the situation in Haiti within the framework of the United Nations, almost all attention is always focused on so-called security issues, which in practice reduces the urgent attention required to the country &apos; s serious structural, economic and social problems.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/159:1	With regard to the humanitarian situation, Guatemala is concerned that, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 20 million people in the Sahel region require humanitarian assistance, particularly in Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/153:2	The first concerns the fight against impunity.	0
2009/s/pv_6236/74:1	Secondly, confidence between the opposition and the ruling party is feared to deteriorate.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/196:3	From that point of view, the restoration of peace, security and national unity is the first challenge to be addressed.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/129:1	We are also concerned about the very high rate of unemployment and widespread poverty in the country.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/147:3	To meet that challenge, a comprehensive and fully Afghan-led approach is essential.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/125:1	My first comment relates to the situation on the ground, which is clearly of concern.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/317:1	Meeting those standards requires the transfer of more powers and responsibilities to local authorities and the acceleration of privatization.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/55:3	After some initial hesitation, the party opted to solve the problem under the law and the party &apos; s constitution, holding new elections for party delegates.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/54:4	In our view, this process must be conducted in such a way as to allow all Afghans to participate equally in the elections, while taking into account the security difficulties we face.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/321:2	Issues were also raised with regard to the delineation of roles and responsibilities of PNTL and F-FDTL	0
2012/s/pv_6729/288:1	Thirdly, the humanitarian situation in Somalia continues to be of concern.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/154:3	Adequate and timely resources are needed to sustain processes that are supposed to be long and complex.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/60:2	However, we are concerned that acts of violence can cause a part of the population to remain away from polling sites in the south and elsewhere.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/184:3	The Rome Statute, adopted earlier that year, was a tremendous step forward by incorporating sexual violence such as rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution and forced pregnancy, for the first time and clearly within an international legal framework, in such a way as to make the prosecution of perpetrators a practical possibility.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/283:1	Cholera continues to pose a serious threat.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/47:2	Since the beginning of the political impasse following the elections of 29 March, the Secretary-General has expressed his concern about the process and politically motivated violence.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/79:4	In other areas, however, progress has fallen short of expectations and many challenges remain.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/108:2	Progress has also been made in the areas of public administration and law enforcement.	0
2002/s/pv_4583/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 1.05 p.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/327:4	I believe that our friends in UNAMA and our allies are well aware of what those requirements are.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/71:3	My Government believes that such acts are not only contrary to international law, but also undermine the concept of the rule of law, which is the key element in the fight against terrorism.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/143:2	Achieving peace, security and stability in that State requires, first and foremost, the elimination of poverty and underdevelopment.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/261:2	However, much remains to be done, particularly in the areas of the rule of law, law enforcement, government capacity, development, the private sector and personal security for all Afghan citizens.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/107:1	We challenge anyone to say that there is now one battle in any corner of the Sudan.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/75:3	Romania reiterates that any act of terrorism is unacceptable and must be condemned.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/183:1	The French authorities are deeply concerned about the continued deterioration of the situation in the northern Gaza Strip during the past week.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/276:1	When I had the opportunity to address the Council on this issue in February (see S/PV.5130), I stated that the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, freedom of movement and decentralization were areas that needed special attention, given their direct relevance to the common goal of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/157:3	The Conference also reminded us of the difficult challenges ahead.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/86:3	That disturbing pattern of activities is a serious concern that threatens to undermine the credibility of United Nations operations.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/172:2	That is why we condemn terrorism.	3
2010/s/pv_6444/52:1	"""The Security Council remains deeply concerned about the security situation in the Central African Republic."	3
2012/s/pv_6734/279:3	That is unacceptable and must be fully condemned, especially by the Security Council, using the means at its disposal.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/324:1	The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains a major concern.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 3.25 p.m.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/80:1	What everyone has to do is reject hard-line voices that find comfort in the old ways and believe that it is impossible for Serbs and Albanians to normalize their relations by reaching a historic compromise.	3
2010/s/pv_6259/53:2	It is no longer possible to ignore the crisis, which has become a more difficult challenge today than ever before.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/248:2	The first edition, published in 2002, noted that the lack of freedom in the Arab world undermined human development and was one of the most painful manifestations of political underdevelopment.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/65:1	The situation along the Lebanese border with Syria remains worrying.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/120:2	But we must not deceive ourselves: this is a challenge for Kosovo as a whole, not just for one minority.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/103:3	Some of the accusations made in the press are mere speculations and it is important that investigations be conducted with the necessary calm.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/184:1	Somalis should be responsible for providing their security and developing their judicial system in order to address the threats to their security.	0
2002/s/pv_4583/49:1	"""The Security Council also expresses its concern at the growing tensions in the Ituri region and calls upon all parties to exercise restraint."	3
2011/s/pv_6579/65:4	Blue Nile State also remains a source of concern to us.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/341:4	The United Nations counter-terrorism bodies should therefore address those shortcomings more seriously and with dedication.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/419:2	Indeed, Azerbaijan itself is in violation of those resolutions, which urge the parties concerned to continue negotiations within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group, as well as through various contacts among them.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/51:2	She expressed the Council and the Secretary-General &apos; s deep concern at the recent increase in tensions between the North and the South, as well as the continued lack of progress on Abyei and other post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/111:1	The Russian delegation notes with deep regret and concern the information on the continuing violence in Darfur.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/58:4	I am deeply concerned about the recent escalation between Gaza and Israel.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/281:4	Clearly, these conditions represent the single biggest obstacle to stability and progress in Afghanistan and, if allowed to continue, threaten to disrupt the progress achieved in nearly three years.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/127:1	Security and stability remain a major challenge.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/55:2	However, the Operation has also demonstrated the magnitude of the challenges that Liberia &apos; s security sector continues to face, particularly with regard to logistics, communications and the mobility of the police and the Immigration Service.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/64:1	Pakistan is deeply concerned by the report &apos; s finding that the humanitarian and economic challenges facing the Sahel have been exacerbated by the consequences of the Libyan crisis.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/151:2	In particular, we condemn any attempt to force UNMIK into any kind of so-called joint rule, as well as any interference with the individual authorities of the Special Representative.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/298:4	We note that civil society organizations have expressed serious concern in this regard.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/61:2	It is clear that all law and order institutions in Iraq face serious challenges.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/65:1	Political pressure on UNMIK has increased significantly with attempts to challenge its role under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/253:5	There is no doubt today that the real intention was to prevent the public dissemination of the details of his reckless acts of destruction committed under the orders of the United States Central Intelligence.	3
2009/s/pv_6236/97:1	The Government also shares a number of concerns expressed in the report on, inter alia, human rights and the situation of women and children.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/176:3	We have serious concerns about that law, which can have far-reaching consequences.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/237:4	However, we believe that a sudden withdrawal will be counterproductive and will create an unprecedented vacuum, especially in view of the fact that the conditions conducive to hoped-for investment, broad-based investment and sustainable development have not yet been fully established.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/333:1	At the outset, I must express our serious concern about the security situation in that country.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/105:1	I must say that the theme chosen for our debate today is a major challenge, although it is a matter of interest.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/185:3	As the report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/634) makes clear, addressing the problem is a difficult challenge.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/162:1	However, my delegation notes with regret that the security situation continues to give rise to concern.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/67:3	I urge Hamas to respond to those appeals.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/114:2	He reiterated his personal condemnation of the incident, which he described as giving the wrong and undesirable messages before the 2012 elections, and which would undermine and hinder the gains made in reshaping the image of the country and in building and consolidating peace, which had been achieved with strenuous efforts, with the assistance of our development partners and the international community.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/93:1	Sadly, the current Palestinian leadership has proved unable to be a partner in peace as it is unable to pursue the reform and democratic governance of its people.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/163:1	First and foremost, security concerns remain critical.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/101:6	It is clear that the conditions for the implementation of this mechanism are not in place in the case of Darfur.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/86:1	First, while Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West African Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere is hampering the exchange of intelligence and early warning.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/125:6	France strongly deplores these attacks and calls on all parties to exercise maximum restraint.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/53:5	The political debate is likely to be protected and consolidated, with numerous electoral-related judicial appeals already filed.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/120:1	The report confirms the disturbing picture of the situation in the Sahel region and the related security, economic and humanitarian concerns.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/335:1	Secondly, Mr. Covic expressed his concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority - Kosovo Serbs - risk losing to the mechanical majority vote, and I would like to say that I believe that the most important aspect of democracy that can be expected is one &apos; s participation, exercise of democratic rights and vote.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/308:1	We express our deep concern at the plight of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/44:3	In Egypt, we have been calling for the peaceful and early transfer of power to a civilian Government.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/144:3	The situation of minorities remains a matter of concern, particularly with regard to freedom of movement and access to justice.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/219:1	Once again, we condemn the killing of civilians on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/134:1	The challenge of establishing local and regional administrations in areas recovered from Al-Shabaab must now be given high priority.	3
2005/s/pv_5243/35:1	Letter dated 26 July 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council	0
2010/s/pv_6353/207:2	We urge the parties to act with restraint and avoid provocative actions or statements that would trigger further violence.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/181:4	The United States urges the Haitian authorities to fulfil their pledge to fill all six vacancies in the Supreme Court by 3 October 2011.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/120:1	We are concerned that the success of the presidential elections may run the risk of being eroded by the lack of progress in the formation of the Government.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/139:2	The challenges facing the country demand that Haitian leaders have a common and unified will.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/65:1	However, the prospect of a complete breakdown of law and order, as well as the collapse of the fragile economy and the disintegration of Palestinian self-government institutions, remains.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/128:4	The negative impact of the Libyan situation, which poses a threat to continued peace and stability in the region, will grow, and China expresses its deep concern in this regard.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/73:1	It remains a matter of great concern to me that the efforts of Liberians to rebuild their judicial system will take time, and therefore the system itself is likely to remain weak and vulnerable in the short term.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/78:6	In 1993, that vision was at best blurry, and at that time it was impossible to determine the ultimate goal that would be close to responding to the concerns of both peoples.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/255:1	We have noted the caution shown by the Secretary-General and the technical assessment mission with regard to security sector reform, in particular with regard to the National Police of Timor-Leste.	3
2011/s/pv_6688/74:2	As I have made clear, I am confident that the Council will not be filled with these false accusations, which are at variance with the right and minimum standards of professionalism.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/96:1	We have taken note of the concern about the implementation of the joint communiqué of 2 April 2009, referred to in the report.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/62:2	This has raised serious tensions with local communities, as well as threats to MONUC by some former CSCE military commanders who are now integrated into the Congolese army.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/140:2	We consider any departure from that principle unacceptable, let alone that the fragile situation in the region may lead to widespread instability.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/61:2	Haiti &apos; s political and civil society leaders continue to rise to national consensus in key areas, such as the national budget, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and constitutional reform.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/216:1	The Jordanian Government stresses the need for the Israeli Government to cease all acts of violence and destruction in the Gaza Strip and throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, put an end to the policy of destroying Palestinian infrastructure and homes, cease extrajudicial killings and impose collective sanctions on the Palestinian people and put an end to the violations being committed by Israel against them.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/153:5	However, we remain concerned that there is too much focus on visits to developing countries.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/320:2	As the United Nations Support Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), we would be irresponsible if we did not appeal to the international community, the Government of Pakistan, the Government of Afghanistan and its national forces to end that situation, particularly on the southern border.	3
2006/s/pv_5492/55:3	Unfortunately for Hizbullah &apos; s actions, and as I said Israel has the right to defend itself, the use of excessive force must be condemned.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/108:1	The new democratic Government of Pakistan has inherited a terrible legacy of political, economic and security challenges.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/234:4	Further development in this direction could jeopardize efforts to reform and build the country and, in the long run, threaten peace and stability throughout the region.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/171:5	We also fenced 25 kilometres of borders and placed flashlights and video cameras at border crossings.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/45:2	As members of the Council are aware, migration from the north to the south has begun, and for the first time it will involve crossing international borders.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/67:4	It would not be in the interests of the Palestinian people to challenge the fundamental pillars of Palestinian legitimacy and national aspirations.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/61:1	The situation in Syria is a source of deep and growing concern to the United Nations.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/173:2	We are particularly concerned about the lack of middle-level training of civil servants, as well as the significant problems that remain in the judicial sphere.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/98:1	The recent decisions of an Indonesian Court of Appeal to repeal four criminal judgements of the ad hoc Human Rights Court, while falling outside the mandate of the Mission, directly affect the larger issue of accountability for crimes.	3
2009/s/pv_6236/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10.55 a.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/58:1	I am particularly concerned about the instability that could arise if the political and socio-economic situations continue to deteriorate.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/285:3	However, there is a need for the will of the United States to place Middle East peace in its priorities, going beyond the disregard and absence that has lasted for almost seven years and has exacerbated the situation in the region.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/48:5	However, this was not so serious as to undermine the process: simple logistical possibilities make it difficult to vote successfully twice on election day.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/198:3	We are also concerned about the situation of those involved in the reconstruction of the country.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/112:2	We are deeply concerned about the insistence of leaders of groups such as the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) on refusing to participate in the talks.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/46:2	The Council condemns all unilateral acts aimed at creating facts on the ground that would prejudice the outcome of the negotiations.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/41:3	The Council stresses that all those responsible for violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law, as well as those who have been instructed to commit such acts, will be held accountable.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/114:4	"Such statements as ""the Palestinian people do not love their children"" or ""the Palestinian people send their children to death because of their hatred of Israel"" are racist and reflect the kind of attitude that should be rejected altogether - and I am trying to do so now."	3
2004/s/pv_5025/176:4	To blame each other, to find a scapegoat responsible for failure in Afghanistan and to demand that those who are already doing so work the most unfair and unacceptable practices that will ultimately be a factor of psychological defeat.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/108:2	We cannot send a message that terrorists will be safe, but only the usual convictions.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/91:4	Many achievements have been made, but many challenges remain.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/124:5	The recent advisory opinion of the Council of Scientists condemning drugs and other related activities could be very useful in discouraging opium poppy production.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/286:3	We therefore urge the members of the Council and the Group of Friends of Haiti to give positive consideration to these recommendations made by the Secretary-General.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/113:4	It seems that peoples not only aspire but also demand that pluralistic and more representative Governments provide tangible benefits to their citizens.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/122:1	Timor-Leste continues to face important challenges in reducing poverty and creating employment opportunities, particularly for its young population.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/152:3	In the light of recent experience, it is also clear that the Tribunal will continue to face some serious challenges.	0
2009/s/pv_6236/59:1	Another election-related challenge is the large number of potential voters who cannot afford the administrative costs of obtaining the national identity card.	0
2011/s/pv_6544/47:2	The Council demands that the Government of the Sudan withdraw immediately from the Abyei Area.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/126:1	Security sector reform remains one of the major challenges to long-term peace and stability.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/174:1	Uganda believes that ending impunity is the only credible deterrent to crimes of serious concern to the international community.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/153:3	We are deeply concerned that if not all sides exercise a strong will to stop acts of terrorism and violence, the peace process will not succeed.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/135:1	We note that in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/269:1	Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continuation of illegal settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/201:3	We are therefore disappointed that the Secretary-General &apos; s report (S/2011/540) recommended only a partial reduction in the increase in troops.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/215:3	Now, what Afghanistan has achieved is being eroded by serious challenges to the country &apos; s security and stability.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/111:1	While piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a critical challenge, we call on the international community not to lose sight of the fact that the solution to that problem must be achieved on land rather than at sea. A comprehensive solution to the Somali conflict must address all the root causes of piracy and other challenges, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic waste.	3
