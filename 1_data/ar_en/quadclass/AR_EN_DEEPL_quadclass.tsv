2012/s/pv_6734/270:1	In this regard, I would like to emphasize once again that, unlike some other known cases involving illegitimate and unfounded territorial claims, including under the fabricated pretext of sponsoring ethnic minorities, the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination and statehood has been recognized.	3
2001/s/pv_4364/4:1	"""At its 4364th meeting, held behind closed doors on 5 September 2001, the Security Council considered the situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo."	0
2004/s/pv_5025/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/198:2	The impasse could increase political tensions and affect the atmosphere of growing confidence that prevailed following the elections and the inauguration of President Martelly.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/147:1	For our part, we directly link the issue of legitimacy to the holding of elections for which preparations are underway within the framework of the Joint Electoral Management Body.	3
2000/s/pv_4183/4:1	"At its 4183rd meeting, held in private on August 3, 2000, the Security Council considered ""The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo""."	0
2007/s/pv_5800/46:1	"""The Security Council reiterates its condemnation of all targeted assassinations of Lebanese leaders, particularly since October 2004, and demands an immediate end to the use of intimidation and violence against representatives of the Lebanese people and institutions."	3
2004/s/pv_5049/270:2	The Cuban delegation strongly condemns the attacks against Palestinian civilians and the general destruction caused by the Israeli occupying forces in the northern Gaza Strip. We also demand an immediate end to those attacks and the urgent withdrawal of the occupying forces.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/75:3	At this moment, Qassam rocket fire from Gaza continues to be deliberately directed against the civilian population, targeting innocent civilians and causing them terror as they sleep in their beds, sit in their living rooms, or take their children to school.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/69:3	I would also like to reiterate that the four members of the Armed Forces of Timor-Leste (F-FDTL) convicted of manslaughter in the shooting death of eight PNTL officers in 2006, one of whom was pardoned and three of whom benefited from reduced sentences, have yet to pay the court-ordered compensation to the widows of the victims.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/275:2	These positions constitute indirect participation in obscuring the Syrian Government's position on what is taking place on its territory and irresponsible incitement to violence in all its forms, which would give international cover to the terrorist acts carried out by armed groups against the interests of the Syrian people and Government.	3
2011/s/pv_6490/50:1	Let's be frank: These reports from the press, human rights groups and civilians on the ground raise serious concerns about the nature and scope of the conflict.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/171:2	The leaders of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government routinely shirk their responsibilities under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/200:1	Among these concerns, one that needs to be highlighted is the deterioration of the security situation in recent weeks and months.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/53:2	It is with great concern that I must report to you again today that despite the significant efforts of UNAMID, the security situation in Darfur has not significantly improved.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/131:2	The socio-economic challenges facing Afghanistan are significant.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/55:3	These regulations cover campaign financing, electoral activities, public order, access to the media, and the misuse of government resources for political purposes.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/164:1	Finally, the widespread institutional, cultural, ethnic, and spiritual diversity in societies currently undergoing profound historical change may lead to particular tensions and security concerns.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/302:4	A true realization of the challenges each country faces individually is crystallizing.	3
2007/s/pv_5738/37:1	The meeting was called to order at 12:45 p.m.	0
2001/s/pv_4300/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 1.20 p.m.	0

2011/s/pv_6618/119:1	"""The rivalry between opposing political forces casts doubt on the country's recent democratic success and threatens its progress towards lasting stability"" (S/2011/540, para. 55)."	3
2008/s/pv_5930/308:1	In conclusion, the challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous, but we are making progress.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/123:2	We are concerned that the living standards of the people have deteriorated as a result of the hardships faced by the country in 2008, particularly as a result of the global food crisis and the damage caused by the hurricanes that hit the island.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/255:1	But there was also concern that any glimmer of hope in the Middle East was met with escalating violence and destruction.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/99:2	In particular, as outlined in the report, I would like to emphasize that the Taliban continues to pose a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and the containment of that organization is crucial.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/124:1	However, Afghanistan continues to face challenges in its pursuit of stabilization and development. Key among them are the security situation, the worsening humanitarian situation, rule of law and human rights challenges and continued violence, resulting in increasing civilian casualties.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/289:1	Fourth, piracy off the coast of Somalia is an international issue that requires our collective efforts and contributions.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/144:2	The Secretary-General unequivocally warns that none of the eight criteria have yet been fully met.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/72:2	We condemn in the strongest terms the brutal attack this morning on the shrine of Imams Ali al-Hadi and Hassan al-Askari in Samarra, and we share the outrage of the Iraqi people over that crime. It is yet another orchestrated attempt by terrorists to sow discord and ignite sectarian strife among the people of Iraq.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/57:6	This means that the separatists continue their blatant disregard for international law and reject the universal principles of the UN Charter.	3
2006/s/pv_5466/50:3	We emphasized the recent tragic effects such messages have had in other parts of the continent.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/77:3	But make no mistake, my country is also prepared to resist a unilateral declaration of independence for as long as there is no settlement in sight.	3
2011/s/pv_6566/47:2	As of June 23, more than 1.1 million people had crossed Libya's borders into Tunisia, Egypt, Niger, Algeria, Chad, and Sudan.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/67:4	So far there has been no improvement in reform management at the national level.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/171:1	We raise the issue of violence in order to express our impatience with regard to finding satisfactory and urgent solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/65:1	I am concerned that this parliamentary vote and parliamentary deadlock could lead to the squandering of hard-won gains by Somali stakeholders and their partners.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/75:5	In all those discussions, I was heartened to discover a convergence of views: We all marvel at how much Liberia has accomplished since the end of the fighting in 2003, but we are all fully aware of the enormity of the challenges still facing Liberia, and that we do not take anything for granted in the end.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/98:4	Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian ad hoc court process, additional remedial measures may be required to achieve justice.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/61:4	This is unacceptable and contradicts even the declared ban by anti-government forces on the use of landmines.	3
2011/s/pv_6490/49:2	In public statements, Colonel Gaddafi and his family members have continued to threaten citizens with civil war and possible mass slaughter if the protests continue.	3
2010/s/pv_6444/52:2	The Council condemns all attacks by local and foreign armed groups that threaten the population, peace and stability of the Central African Republic and the subregion, including the attacks on Birao by CPJP on 19 July and 24 November.	3
2006/s/pv_5492/42:1	The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon - ratified by this Council six years ago - would bring security along its northern border, have found themselves subject to constant rocket attacks from Hezbollah, reaching deeper and deeper into Israeli territory every day.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/228:5	The number of attacks targeting national and international security forces, employees of public institutions, humanitarian workers and state representatives has increased. Attacks against polling sites and threats against voter registration teams have also increased.	3
2009/s/pv_6111/60:4	Recent incidents of indiscipline in the DIS, particularly the allegation that a DIS commander killed a civilian in Farchana on March 22, illustrated this.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/309:2	We note that the ongoing challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/137:1	At the same time, my delegation believes that the elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, especially the Serbian representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their constituents if they adopted a more participatory approach, rather than withdrawing from the Assembly whenever they are faced with a difficult situation.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/229:2	We should not underestimate the threat posed by the destabilizing activities of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/57:2	While neither side appears ready to return to war, there is a worrying pattern of escalation and destabilization that could lead to a full-scale confrontation that would put more civilian lives at risk.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/140:2	However, the situation inside Kosovo today is still of concern to us.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/179:1	Like other speakers who have spoken before us, and in line with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the act that led to the death of Mr. Dzekovic and the injury of several others during protests in northern Mitrovica on 2 July.	3
2007/s/pv_5718/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 11:25 a.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/151:1	We urge Israel to stop its military strikes in Gaza.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/124:3	South Africa emphasizes that, given the magnitude of these challenges, a comprehensive strategy that encompasses security, humanitarian efforts, good governance and socio-economic development is required.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/56:1	Recent developments in the region underscore concerns frequently expressed to the mission by its interlocutors.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/199:1	We also note that the escalation of violence is forcing entire communities to leave to escape the violence.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/186:2	Such actions are completely unacceptable. The Palestinian Authority must put an end to these attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/252:1	Through our previous discussions, Belgium has shared the concern expressed by the Secretary-General about the threat that violence in Iraq poses to an already fragile society, institutions and political process.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/138:2	We call on the Palestinian Authority to do everything in its power to stop these attacks.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/216:1	In conclusion, although Timor-Leste has made significant progress, it still faces many serious challenges in its quest for a stable democracy and economic development.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/252:5	The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees for its security as a state.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/187:2	Obviously, this was due to the countries in question rejecting his actions.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/387:2	It is important to give women, who are the primary victims of violence in all its manifestations, a key role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding and, more importantly and urgently, in conflict prevention.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/52:4	However, challenges remain on the road to achieving lasting peace and stability in Darfur.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/171:4	These actions are being taken despite the SRSG's clearly negative stance and are in defiance of the UN and the Security Council.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/124:2	The alarming drug situation calls for further action.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/233:1	The challenge is to ensure that our outrage is translated into specific and meaningful action, yielding early measurable results.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/254:4	They insist on treating the case as a minor immigration offense.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/97:2	I also say today what I said on 31 January (see S/PV.6710). It is unacceptable that the Council should be prevented from fulfilling its responsibilities.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/168:2	His mission represents the last chance to prevent Syria from descending into civil war.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/353:5	This is despite the repeated condemnation of these inhumane acts by Security Council resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), which have become a source of hope for millions of women and girl victims around the world.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/66:5	The second reason is to once again call on the Security Council to take urgent and necessary action to stop the bloodshed in Syria.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/273:1	In the face of this blatant threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without resorting to the double standards that have characterized its previous actions in this regard, so that it can urgently and decisively adopt the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the members of the Arab Group.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/40:1	The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to remind all speakers, as I indicated at this morning's meeting, to limit their statements to no more than five minutes, so that the Council can complete its work expeditiously.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/324:2	In our view, cross-border infiltration is not the primary cause of extremist violence in Afghanistan, including in the south and southeast.	0
2010/s/pv_6431/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 4:10 p.m.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/253:1	Despite the difficulties we face when reading the report before us, it identifies the challenges we face.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/291:1	In conclusion, in the context of peace in the world and the Middle East, I would like to emphasize that while we understand all the needs that arise in terms of security, it would be better for that region and the whole world if the situation in Iran is stopped from moving towards conflict because it would be the kind of conflict that would have a very unfortunate impact on the world, the last straw that would break the camel's back as far as world peace is concerned.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/153:1	We are deeply concerned about the fact that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated by one side against the other, despite clear expressions of revulsion by the international community and the Security Council.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/176:3	It also appears that quite a few logistical needs must be met in order to finalize the handover.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/317:3	Given its current political status, Kosovo is still distant from foreign direct investment and lacks the eligibility to benefit from IMF and World Bank programs and assistance, which would have a direct impact on creating a stable and efficient economy.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/215:4	This is an important step in the right direction.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/56:3	Tensions along the border could turn into serious violence during the migration period in the Abyei region, from which neither side has fully withdrawn.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/97:3	This will require stronger measures regarding the expulsion of those who, under threat of violence, illegally use Serbian property.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/71:2	The first is that demands for human rights and freedom are universal and will generalize themselves over time, because they are basic human aspirations.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/195:7	We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to comply with the obligation set out in resolution 2036 (2012) to prohibit trade in Somali charcoal, particularly by those most active in the trade.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/172:6	Israel has legitimate security concerns, but those concerns can only be fully and effectively addressed through a negotiated settlement.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/230:1	At the same time, we are concerned about the observation in the report that the work on the demarcation of the land boundary between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is not proceeding quickly.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/65:2	This is important to strengthen MONUSCO's ability to provide real protection to the Congolese civilian population, which has been the victim of a clear humanitarian disaster, as Mr. Doss stressed, and widespread human rights violations, particularly violence against women and children.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/185:1	The United Kingdom, perhaps better than others around this table, given our role as a leading nation, knows how great another long-term challenge is: The challenge of counter-narcotics.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/114:2	Therefore, I focused more on opportunities than challenges in my statement.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/220:1	Actions that may undermine or damage confidence in the outcome of negotiations must stop and be reversed.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/219:4	The blockade must be lifted immediately to allow Gaza's civilian population access to water, work, commerce, medical care and education - access to their basic needs.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/263:1	I would like to remind speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes so that the Council can complete its work expeditiously.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/218:1	My delegation remains concerned that the security situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/151:3	We must reject any attempts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/92:3	Thus, the terrorists failed in their strategic goal of preventing the participation of large numbers of volunteers in rebuilding the country.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/135:3	We were even prevented from condemning the violence and endorsing a peace plan developed by Syria's neighbors.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/93:1	The rhetoric from both sides, the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan, is deeply troubling.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/247:1	Once again, Egypt is calling for an immediate halt to Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/246:3	It outlines the issues that require attention and concludes - with the encouragement of Somali women - that the international community should raise gender equality issues, including with Somali leaders.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/185:1	Despite the overall progress, it must be noted that poverty and unemployment remain a formidable challenge, Ms. Haque stressed.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/255:2	We are deeply concerned that the ad hoc process created for this purpose has failed.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/51:2	However, the challenges involved will be much greater, as these will be one-day events, and the logistics will be complicated by Liberia's heavy rainy season.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/252:2	Nevertheless, the Chad experience has left a strong imprint on European peacekeepers and increased our awareness of the challenge facing the UN in that regard.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/111:4	Combating this scourge requires strengthening our criminal prosecution capacity, our judicial system, our civilian police, and even our prison system.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/257:2	We noted with concern the Secretary-General's assessment that many of the factors that triggered the 2006 crisis are still present in society, making it vulnerable to instability.	3
2011/s/pv_6490/42:1	We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d'Ivoire, as the Council may have witnessed in my statement earlier today.	3
2002/s/pv_4583/45:2	It also emphasizes that it is Rwanda's duty to use its strong influence to ensure that the RCD does not take such actions.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/68:1	The ability of national security forces to respond to these threats in remote areas remains limited due to capacity constraints.	0
2012/s/pv_6708/46:4	The important challenges and issues related to security and national reconciliation that, in my opinion, require the Council's political attention should not be underestimated.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/260:2	According to these resolutions, this organ must demand that the United States government immediately sentence Luis Posada Carriles for terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose judicial system has been pursuing him for years.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/154:2	More efforts must be made by the Haitian government and international humanitarian organizations in preventive activities, such as the provision of sanitation and clean water.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/46:1	"""The Council expresses deep concern at reports of an unusual and sudden influx of thousands of Misseriya into Abyei town and surrounding areas, which could significantly alter the ethnic fabric of the region."	3
2008/s/pv_5930/361:2	We must now accelerate action to fulfill our mutual commitments.	0
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/137:2	The EU truly believes that strong socio-economic development is required to maintain and consolidate nascent stability.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/216:1	Whatever its capabilities, no country in our region can face the challenges of terrorism, separatism, and development on its own and win the bets of openness and democracy.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/251:3	The mission requirements related to resolution 1325 (2001) were more specific and detailed during EUFOR's deployment compared to the subsequent deployment of UNAMA forces.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/143:1	As serious and condemnable as this incident is, it is an isolated incident.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/135:2	The conflicts there have complex root causes involving multiple factors, including political differences, unequal distribution of economic resources, and tribal clashes. The potential for renewed and extended conflict remains. Achieving peace will continue to require sustained efforts on the part of all parties.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/174:2	All concerned must ensure that Kosovo is a place of ethnic tolerance and pluralism where communities can coexist peacefully.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/64:3	I believe the combination of his assumption of this role and Ambassador Jurica's chairmanship of the Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee has brought new vitality to our counter-terrorism work.	0
2012/s/pv_6708/48:1	The holding of legislative elections without delay and in a relatively peaceful atmosphere is, in our view, a major achievement that represents a major step forward in restoring constitutional order, more inclusive governance, and finalizing the remaining key aspects of the peace process.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/177:2	The peoples of the world are demanding universal human rights.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/191:2	In this regard, the recommendations made by the assessment team to prevent the spread of conflicts, the destabilization of states and the exacerbation of humanitarian issues deserve close attention.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/159:1	We urge Israel to abide by its obligations regarding the population in the occupied territories.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/330:1	In a post-conflict environment, the challenges facing women remain immense.	0
2010/s/pv_6259/68:3	However, the failure to intervene effectively to restore stability in that country truly threatens the effectiveness of the international community as well as the cost in terms of enormous resources.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/140:1	Despite all efforts to restore peace and security, we remain concerned about the recent significant setbacks to stabilization efforts in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).	3
2004/s/pv_4934/82:4	Furthermore, Chile believes that operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution contains a condemnation of suicide attacks against civilians only.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/109:1	The Republic of South Sudan is gravely concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the border areas of the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/200:1	"""The Council notes with concern the challenges in the area of social and economic development, with a marked deterioration in the living standards of the vast majority of Haitians."	3
2003/s/pv_4770/113:3	We see great achievements and signs of optimism in this direction.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/151:4	This is an international obligation that states must fulfill to ensure justice for the victims of these reprehensible acts.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/103:1	He informed council members that all necessary steps have been and will continue to be taken to apprehend the perpetrators as quickly as possible.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/60:2	It is not only the election timetable that is clearly visible, but the situation along Liberia's border with Côte d'Ivoire requires close monitoring of potential security repercussions.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/234:1	In this regard, while counterterrorism has been taken more seriously by the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular, there is limited evidence of real joint efforts to create a greater international response to terrorism.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/55:1	We know that conflict situations are usually characterized by a breakdown of law and order.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/224:3	Our main concern in that regard is the fact that, according to the report, none of the eight key criteria have yet been fully implemented.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/111:1	Afghanistan will face critical challenges in the coming months.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/34:1	The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo	0
2009/s/pv_6234/43:1	"""The Security Council notes with deep concern the postponement of the first round of the presidential elections, scheduled for 29 November 2009 in accordance with the communiqué issued on 18 May 2009 by the Permanent Consultative Framework of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement, endorsed by all Ivorian political actors."	3
2012/s/pv_6729/122:2	Monitoring and identifying violations of the arms embargo, and applying targeted sanctions where appropriate, must be strengthened in order to minimize the potentially devastating effects of the operation in the Somali context.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/298:3	Timor-Leste has made important steps toward addressing its difficult legacy, but significant and pressing challenges remain.	0
2010/s/pv_6259/66:4	Protecting civilians is a long-neglected duty in Somalia.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/64:3	The splinter group of parliamentarians rejected the Garowe process and put forward a proposal to bring forward the presidential election from July to April 30 this year.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/73:1	The overall challenge is to take the incremental steps that have been implemented, intensify them and make them transformative.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/134:1	First, let me emphasize the importance of building on the current negotiations, including the Israeli-Palestinian and Israel-Syria tracks.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/239:5	However, it is unacceptable for Israel to invoke its legitimate security concerns to justify the imposition of measures that affect an entire people indiscriminately and in violation of international humanitarian law.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/252:3	But we are concerned that the key factor in decision-making is being undermined by the lack of political consensus.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/188:3	While leaders in the region have taken bold measures to combat this scourge, the Libyan crisis has exacerbated the situation.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:3	A gender perspective must be part of the reform and training of all security forces.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/117:1	We are concerned that the security situation remains an issue.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/158:1	The first issue is the drug situation in Afghanistan, which poses a serious and growing challenge not only to Afghanistan but also to the rest of the world.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/182:2	We are concerned about the lack of political freedoms there.	3
2006/s/pv_5597/80:2	In this regard, we would like to reiterate what we have said on previous occasions, namely that the most serious challenge facing this investigation is the continued exploitation by some parties in our region or beyond to jump to preconceived political conclusions that are irrelevant to the requirements of the investigation and are not based on solid evidence and proof.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/212:1	However, the security situation remains a cause for concern for all, although the number of security-related incidents decreased in December 2011 and January 2012, compared to the previous two-month period last year.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/177:1	We note that efforts to reform local government have been delayed.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/53:3	The violence and displacement represent a direct challenge to the credibility of the voting process.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/214:2	Fighting impunity is also crucial to preventing sexual violence.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/236:2	These actions undermine the fragile foundations of the Afghan state and hinder long-term stabilization.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/103:3	At this stage of the peacebuilding process, such behavior can be misunderstood and can incite violence, which can then turn into conflict.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/86:2	The challenge now is to build on that foundation and turn the promise of peace into reality.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/256:1	South Africa has always been among the countries that have condemned all acts of violence, terrorism, indiscriminate and excessive use of force and physical destruction of property.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/318:2	This type of interaction can enable preventive action to be taken in a timely manner.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/95:2	Terrorism poses a serious challenge to our security, the fundamental principles of democratic societies and the rights and freedoms of our citizens.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/176:4	But we are concerned about reports of increased tensions between the ruling and opposition parties.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/136:1	Sahel countries are making progress in counterterrorism capabilities.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/168:3	The mission's recommendations in this regard require serious consideration.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/220:2	It is absolutely essential to avoid any actions, activities or statements that could undermine or hinder peace efforts.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/177:5	Local government reform programs should not wait for final status negotiations.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/51:8	Elections held after a long conflict are meant to establish the political legitimacy of a post-war regime.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/49:3	But, as I said in Tuesday's open session, events must be seen in context, and the Security Council will do nothing to contribute to a peaceful settlement when it condemns the actions of one side and turns a blind eye to everything else going on in the region.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/65:1	Perhaps the biggest long-term challenges for Timor-Leste will be social and economic.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/272:3	At the same time, Cuba condemns suicide bombings and other acts against Israeli civilians, who are innocent victims of the cycle of violence driven by the policy of their Government. We also reject the use of these sporadic acts to question the legitimate exercise of self-defence by the Palestinian people and to justify activities, committed on a large scale or selectively, against the Palestinian population.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/297:1	First, it is important to take into account two equally legitimate desires: On the one hand, there is the demand of minorities to live in security, to have the same opportunities for economic development, to have the same access to social services and education, and to exercise their right to return; on the other hand, there is the desire of the majority population to exercise their right to self-determination.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/59:1	Few Iraqi families have survived the scourge of violence and human rights violations. It is only natural that many of these families feel a deep sense of injustice.	0
1999/s/pv_3969/43:1	"""The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the impact of the conflict on the Angolan people and the impact of the conflict on the Angolan people."	3
2004/s/pv_5049/82:3	This Council should not allow that strategy to be rewarded by addressing the response to terrorism rather than terrorism itself. It must be rejected, not appeased.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/51:2	In this regard, the Council condemns, in the strongest terms, the continued threats and acts of intimidation against UNAMA personnel.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/332:1	Let me start by reiterating the European Union's deep concern about the situation in Somalia and the regional repercussions of the conflict.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/250:1	While we recognize the challenges that implementation will face, we believe that sustainable development cannot be achieved in the region without effective institutions based on good governance and the availability of the necessary resources, which can only be provided in the context of security and stability.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:1	One of the key issues in post-conflict countries is security sector reform.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/214:5	They do not recognize the illegal and unilateral attempt at secession by the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/340:2	However, there are still concerns regarding the 2.3 million people still living in a crisis situation.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/130:1	But we are concerned by recent developments, including further tensions between members of local communities and ISAF forces.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/225:2	However, the situation remains a concern, given the long border that separates our two countries, which is difficult to exercise control over.	3
2005/s/pv_5243/46:1	I should like to draw members' attention to document S/2005/436, which contains the text of a letter dated July 26, 2005, from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/48:2	The operation went well, with no major security incidents or logistical challenges.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/62:1	The main Palestinian factions in Lebanon expressed concern about the incidents and distanced themselves from Fatah al-Islam.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/256:4	The Council should call for an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from the area.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/86:2	The limited ability within the region to track financial flows is another major challenge, especially given that illicit profits can exacerbate corruption.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/75:4	But let's be honest with each other - there is no issue in Kosovo that does not concern the center, directly or indirectly.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/91:2	By contemplating initiatives that reward this strategy in practice, the Council is only emboldening terrorists and undermining the letter and spirit of the road map.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/63:2	We have undoubtedly underestimated the humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan. Mr. John Holmes will elaborate on this topic.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/56:4	He rejected the arrest of Ali Kushayb and Ahmad Harun.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/54:3	Throughout those difficult days and weeks, Kosovo's political leaders and citizens managed that highly exceptional situation in a mature manner, without disruption or destabilization.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/290:1	In addition, we have refocused our efforts to be more effective in Afghanistan, particularly in Kandahar Province.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/129:3	Here at the Security Council, there are three cases in particular that require our attention today.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/88:6	A one-state solution may satisfy many basic Palestinian desires, but it does not fulfill the necessary requirement for Israelis to maintain self-determination and sovereignty.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/102:1	This situation continues even as the Libyan authorities have no opportunity to fully control the situation in their own country or to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist elements.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/118:2	Palestinians must end public incitement to violence and do their best to prevent militants from attacking Israel, provoking an Israeli response.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/60:1	We are confident that these groups will not be able to undermine the electoral process at the national level.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/71:2	I spent four days in Afghanistan at the end of June to assess the humanitarian situation, given growing concerns about the severity of the humanitarian situation and the issue of protection of civilians.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/56:1	Palestinians feel that the struggle is a battle of resistance that they fight every day for their identity and to prevent the possibility of having a future as a people from fading away.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/127:1	The situation on the ground is also alarming from a humanitarian point of view. The Secretary-General emphasizes that Iraq is in a major crisis and states that the situation is deteriorating.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/66:6	Although the reserve unit's official training period officially ended on August 23, it is estimated that at least three additional months of intensive training and on-the-job supervision are needed.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/72:1	At the same time, Germany and the EU have repeatedly in the past condemned terrorist crimes that have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/87:3	Sustainable and effective democratic governance is a goal to be pursued with great determination, but also with a sense of urgency everywhere, and Haiti is no exception.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/73:4	There is no doubt that the structure and development of public administration in Timor-Leste remains an important challenge and must be taken into account.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/273:3	This is what makes the irresponsible threatening rhetoric of the Iranian leadership all the more disturbing.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/53:4	They must maintain their independence and objectivity in order to instill confidence in the electoral process.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/61:1	Under international law, Israel, as the occupying power, is obligated to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, and to preserve civilian property.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/63:2	Improving this situation requires the enforcement of laws - particularly the law on the elimination of violence against women - that criminalize and punish violence and harmful practices against women and girls.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/65:1	Last Sunday, on the occasion of Hamas' 21st anniversary, Hamas leader Haniyeh refused to allow Abbas to remain in office until the internal division is resolved.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/337:1	As long as we are discussing the development challenges facing Afghanistan, the latest incident justifies the gloomy picture of the security situation.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/224:4	In this context, the EU reminds Israel of its obligation to ensure full and safe access for humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/183:1	Although a senior official of the Provisional Institutions of Kosovo and Metohija recently tried to explain this failure by citing high unemployment rates, the facts point in another direction.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/312:2	Building a sustainable economy fueled by a culture of democratic and transparent governance that creates jobs and helps fulfill the basic social functions of the state will be another serious challenge in the near future.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/426:1	We consider Armenia's position to be an open and direct challenge to the conflict settlement process and a serious threat to international and regional peace and security.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/191:1	The delegation of Togo believes that all these issues require urgent action to prevent the Sahel region from falling into total insecurity, which would be very detrimental to its development.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/111:1	At the same time, other essential elements in this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by increasing the effectiveness, integrity and overall performance of the judiciary, and strengthening law enforcement institutions to reduce organized crime and ethnic violence and bring all criminals to justice.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/98:2	This will require a clear stance, especially, and quite frankly, from the United States.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/108:2	We are addressing these challenges democratically and effectively.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/265:3	It is clear that continued international assistance is required, and as the Secretary-General noted in his report.	0
2011/s/pv_6548/50:1	Meanwhile, President al-Bashir is threatening the international community with retaliation, and thus more crimes.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/117:1	In the current situation, which is very difficult, we call on both Israelis and Palestinians to de-escalate the conflict and start implementing their obligations under the road map, in order to revitalize the prospects for peace.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/188:8	We now have a better understanding of the magnitude of the challenges we could only guess at.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/52:2	If these issues are resolved in favor of the prosecution, the defendants will plead guilty to the charges against them.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/115:2	He added that the incident would undermine peace, security and stability in the country.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/212:2	Despite these challenges, it is important to recognize that almost 50 percent of the Afghan population lives in areas where security has been transferred to the Afghan security forces.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/211:1	The humanitarian consequences of the continuing violence in Iraq are of grave concern to my delegation.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/145:2	Minorities, especially the Serbian minority, have a fundamental duty to fully engage in the search for solutions by utilizing every opportunity to participate in Kosovo's institutions.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/229:3	It is time for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most basic rights of the Palestinian people and break the vicious cycle of violence caused by Israel's continued illegal occupation of Palestinian land.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/326:1	Brazil is also convinced that a stable Somalia requires a comprehensive strategy that combines security and development.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/110:2	All of this requires waging a vigorous war against entrenched informal actors whose presence poses a threat and impediment to the full exercise of sovereignty by the Afghan state.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/333:7	We are disappointed, Mr. President, that despite your efforts and those of many others, the Council could not condemn that brutal terrorist attack.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/174:4	But despite these achievements, challenges to the government's authority and effective control over its national territory still need to be overcome.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/408:3	It is also indisputable that Armenia, as the occupying Power, bears direct responsibility for the commission of those crimes.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/295:1	In order to achieve more meaningful and robust progress, the international community should act in a more coherent manner and with greater determination to put in place the necessary basic framework.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/64:1	The political stalemate within the Transitional Federal Parliament is another challenge.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/171:2	In that context, we remain concerned about the most vulnerable in Timor-Leste: The poor and homeless.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/84:4	It is part of an oft-repeated chant before this Council that does not get any more true, ignoring both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights, and failing to recognize the extreme difficulties that Israeli forces face in trying to protect their citizens and minimize harm to Palestinian lives while the terrorists they face show no more concern for Palestinian lives than they do for Israeli lives.	3
2007/s/pv_5788/68:3	We note the security concerns that Israel says compel it to continue its overflights, particularly allegations of violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to resolution 1701 (2006).	3
2008/s/pv_6049/229:4	Today I will only emphasize the following four points.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/74:5	Lack of land and jobs, as well as insecurity, prevent many returnees from settling in their original communities.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/154:2	The German government strongly condemns these acts of violence.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/404:1	Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): First of all, I would like to apologize for asking for the floor again, as we felt that it would be inappropriate and unproductive to ignore the comments made by the representative of Armenia and his attempt to mislead the Security Council into silence.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/239:1	The ongoing plight and suffering of the Palestinian people remains a tragic reflection of the consequences of the refusal to implement Security Council resolutions and the failure of the Security Council to enforce its own resolutions.	3
2008/s/pv_5919/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 6:10 p.m.	0
2007/s/pv_5788/54:2	Earlier this month, Prime Minister Fayyad circulated a summary of the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan 2008-2010.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/112:2	The political incident was strongly condemned by a press release from the office of President Ernest Bai Koroma, as well as by several press releases from political interest groups, including the APC, the People's Movement for Democratic Change, the Independent Media Commission, the Political Parties Registration Commission, and the Campaign for Good Governance.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/152:4	We could go on to mention widespread poverty, issues with natural resource management, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, thousands more ex-combatants awaiting reintegration, unreformed security sectors, massive human rights violations, and many other threats that have the potential to fuel a new conflict.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/89:2	In that regard, we believe that the destructive action aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be unequivocally condemned.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/91:1	While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side claimed that the other was responsible for provoking the incident.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/161:3	We would also like to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents could lead to an unstable situation in the region, making it difficult to achieve a peaceful solution to the situation in Kosovo that is acceptable to both parties.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/75:3	Israel must also refrain from taking unilateral actions in Jerusalem that would alter the status quo or undermine trust.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/205:2	Combined with intolerance and deeply rooted in the political and social life of the region, organized crime threatens the very foundation of principles and values we are trying to instill in the new institutions formed there, and our efforts are in vain.	3
2010/s/pv_6259/58:5	As a result, the line has been crossed regarding security threats to many countries in Africa and beyond, including member states of this Council, exposing their vulnerabilities.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/59:1	Beyond the humanitarian challenges, the situation raises security concerns.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/201:2	As we have always emphasized, this position does not prejudge the merits of the case; rather, it is a firm call to give both justice and the political process a chance.	0
2004/s/pv_4952/90:4	But the task is not impossible to accomplish if we set realistic, principled goals and move toward them with deliberate steps, and if we have the support of others and are not alone when we take those steps.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/202:1	As a measure to optimize the use of the Council's time and to allow as many delegations as possible to speak, I will not invite individual speakers to take seats at the Council table and then return to their seats at the side of the room.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/135:3	Failure by any member state to comply with its obligations under the Charter should have consequences, and Sudan should not be exempt.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/105:2	As I have emphasized on many occasions, lasting security and stability for any country, as well as for Timor-Leste, can only be achieved in conjunction with socio-economic development.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/224:2	We believe that Somalia faces a challenge similar to that of a marathon runner, because the drafting of the constitution must be completed by April 20 and its adoption completed by May 22.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/213:3	The impunity of these high-ranking officers is unacceptable and prevents post-conflict societies from recovering sustainably.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/282:1	The Afghan authorities and the international community must make it clear that this behavior is unacceptable.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/187:5	Pristina has so far rejected every initiative in that regard.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/108:3	In this regard, the actions taken to address serious issues in the correctional system are encouraging despite the serious challenges that remain.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/69:2	Although the president acted within his constitutional powers, I discussed with him concerns that the December 25, 2009 amnesties could reinforce the perception of impunity.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/72:1	The Arab Spring reaffirms what history warns, that when governments respond with an iron fist to the irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands, and unquenchable hopes of their citizens, they are doomed to fall in the long run.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/52:2	The progress made, and I hope there is no doubt that some progress has been made, must be seen in the context of the challenges Kosovo faces.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/250:3	First, it caused an ongoing humanitarian emergency that also threatened peace and stability in Haiti.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/259:7	Developing an effective Somali judicial capacity will also enable Somalis to tackle the scourge of terrorism and piracy.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/308:2	It is clear that collective efforts require a great deal of resources and a better integration process - a fact embodied in the Bucharest and Paris outcome documents.	0
2006/s/pv_5465/54:1	"Greece therefore insists that the sixth preambular paragraph -- where the Council urges ""progress towards the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement"" -- should be clarified - It should be emphasized once again that such negotiations should take place between the two communities."	3
2010/s/pv_6259/100:1	In that regard, we would go further to say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to empower the Somali security forces to subdue the toughest insurgents and enable the government to expand its areas of authority as much as possible if peace negotiations fail.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/276:2	In his report, the Secretary-General notes some measures of improvement in all of those areas except for the central issue of local government reform, in particular, decentralization, where there is a lack of progress.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/137:3	The Court's intervention must be a catalyst for decisive national and international action to address the challenges of justice in conflict situations.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/53:1	He expressed some concerns - shortly before several presidential candidates - about the integrity of the registration.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/344:4	In order to continue this fight, it is imperative that the international community make a greater contribution and pay more attention to this important aspect of the fight against terrorism.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/109:2	Somalia's long-term security and stability will require an effective and credible judicial system.	0
2002/s/pv_4582/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 1 p.m.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/178:8	It's a bumpy road, requiring patience and perseverance.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/189:2	My delegation strongly condemns these acts of violence and offers its condolences to the family of the deceased pediatrician.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/116:2	"In return, the authorities in Belgrade must end their obstructionist approach, which prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo's public institutions. The ""empty seat policy"" poses serious risks of writing Kosovo's history without Kosovo Serb participation."	3
2011/s/pv_6618/140:2	The Haitian National Police needs sufficient resources to be able to fulfill its constitutional law enforcement duty.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/102:2	Similarly, I can recognize the need for the international community to direct its attention and resources to other hotspots of tension around the world.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/101:1	We are particularly concerned about the indiscriminate proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond its borders as a result of the conflict.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/158:3	This will truly demonstrate the global nature of the UN's counter-terrorism efforts and the fact that member states are united.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/105:4	This is a complex challenge for Sahel countries and regional agencies.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/76:2	We urge Israel to take further action to remove settlement outposts in accordance with the Road Map, and to address the growing threat of settler extremism.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/161:2	A larger United Nations presence is indeed vital, but for the added value of our organization to be fully effective, sufficient funds must be provided for both personnel and security. Mr. Eide reminded us of that a few moments ago.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/77:1	As for the military aspects of SSR, the government has made it clear that it wants to rely heavily on bilateral aid to build the capacity of the military.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/286:4	In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the continued lack of progress in the areas of freedom of movement of minorities, sustainable returns and relevant representation of minorities in government structures and throughout the public sector.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/184:1	My Government recognizes the many expressions of condemnation and outrage that have resulted from this terrible incident. We particularly appreciate the swift reaction of the Security Council to this heinous crime.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/238:4	Indeed, given the history of foreign interference, such directives would not only be viewed with skepticism by various sectors of society but could also exacerbate the issue.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/136:1	Above all, our concerns were related to the Pristina authorities' insistence on implementing the so-called strategy for northern Kosovo in flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which remains the main international legal framework for a settlement in Kosovo.	3
2005/s/pv_5336/44:1	Members of the Council have before them document S/2005/745, containing the text of a letter dated 7 December 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the report of the Panel of Experts on Liberia.	0
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/55:1	In particular, we would like to express our deep concern about the stagnation in Haiti's socio-economic development and food security.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/214:3	But we note that without a strong justice and security sector, developing peace and stability can be threatened.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/166:1	The international community has clearly expressed its strong condemnation of these actions, through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Friends of Syria group, which has a broad and wide participation.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/324:4	The five or six incidents in border areas - at least the reported ones - occurred in places like Nangarhar and Zabul, near the Pakistani border.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/299:6	This is a matter of great urgency, because Kenya cannot continue to bear the burden of this situation.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/92:2	Clearly, the Executive Directorate should continue its efforts to achieve these goals.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/260:4	The threat that terrorists, criminals, and those involved in the narcotics trade pose to the security and stability of Afghanistan is real and must be continually addressed.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/71:9	By the end of this year, we expect to have the tools to better enforce the law in the area of counter-narcotics.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/354:4	We condemn all terrorist acts committed in Afghanistan, particularly the most recent one against the Indian Embassy in Kabul, and express our condolences to the governments and peoples of the affected countries and to the families and relatives of the victims.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/103:2	The collection of objective, reliable, accurate and timely information on conflict-related sexual violence is critical to formulating Council responses, as well as strengthening action to prevent sexual violence.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/124:4	The true establishment of the rule of law in the DRC requires the formation of an army, a justice system and a police force that is effective and democratic.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/241:1	The international community - including through the auspices of the United Nations - should use diplomatic influence and provide technical assistance in areas such as political, security and justice sector reforms, the drafting of new constitutions, legal frameworks, electoral institutions and the conduct of elections.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/154:1	Continued instability in the Sahel has implications beyond the countries most directly affected.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/68:5	It calls for adherence to international law and for all parties to implement their commitments and the roadmap in order to realize the vision of two states living side by side in peace and security.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/227:4	We cannot risk wasting human and financial investment in the DRC because of citizen frustration, which could ultimately lead to a renewed crisis.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/187:4	It would be remiss of the Council not to use these tools if the need arises.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/276:2	Under these conditions of massive disparities and political, economic, and social marginalization, a process has emerged that seeks to change the prevailing system, to bring about economic and political change, to find alternatives that allow for participation and open up new spaces and means of expression, in short, demands for basic rights.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/241:1	ISAF soldiers must fully implement their mandate to eliminate threats emanating from Afghanistan.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/165:1	In my delegation's view, in order to prevent new violence and stabilize northern Kosovo, it remains essential that the reconciliation process be accompanied by policies aimed at ensuring the social and economic stability of the communities in a non-discriminatory manner.	3
2011/s/pv_6662/49:3	Withholding this level of funding would paralyze any government, let alone an authority under occupation, and if these funds are not immediately released, this action will threaten the state-building gains made by the PA, including the promotion of good governance that benefits the Palestinian people and the development of security forces that maintain law and order in the West Bank.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/54:2	As Security Council members know better than anyone, the Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the greatest perennial diplomatic challenges the world has faced since the mid-20th century. At the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a conflict between competing and contradictory historical narratives and collective aspirations and identities.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/160:1	Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a concern shared by all States Members of the United Nations and the entire international community.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/116:8	This, of course, has led to growing public concern and some have questioned the over-reliance on the military option.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/232:2	But the grave risk remains that as a result of this decision - which violates the Bonn and Berlin documents - the country will face an explosive situation fraught with new armed resistance and internal divisions in the power structures.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/265:1	Finding a starting point for discussions about the looming challenges that Middle Eastern societies find themselves facing and extrapolating the promising opportunities resulting from these challenges can be a daunting task.	0
2006/s/pv_5603/251:1	Addressing the root causes of the economic deficit requires the establishment of permanent projects based on sound commercial and economic fundamentals, especially since the region is strategically located on the African continent and has enormous natural resources.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/284:7	They are the ones who do all these things, and then ask for protection and guarantee and put it as a mask in order to blackmail and get more concessions.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/57:1	Since the release of the report, there has been a significant increase in focus on Liberia's border with Côte d'Ivoire.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/265:1	In assessing that progress, it is important to recognize how far Timor-Leste has come in the few years since independence, but it is equally important to acknowledge the significant challenges that still lie ahead.	0
2007/s/pv_5788/58:1	I would also like to emphasize effective Arab diplomacy in the period leading up to the conference.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/145:2	Preventing illegal border crossings is vital in countering terrorism, drug trafficking, and commercial smuggling.	3
2004/s/pv_4952/69:5	There are certainly people who are uncomfortable with what they see as an excessive and indeed negative preoccupation with sectarian balance.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/59:3	Although about 80 percent of Afghans are directly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods, very little of our efforts have been invested in the sector.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/129:2	Unless the government addresses these two issues, they could pose serious threats to Timor-Leste's security and stability.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/87:2	However, prevention will only be effective if peacekeeping operations have the resources they need to fulfill their mandate.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/271:4	The PA's ability to build reliable institutions and security infrastructure, with the will and capacity to combat terrorism and other threats, is an essential element of the Palestinian state-building process and a legitimate aspiration on the Israeli side.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/287:1	It is clear that ultimate progress in these areas will require more concerted efforts by the international community, Belgrade and the people of Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/66:2	According to Viet Nam, the diverse nature of violence against women and girls requires a holistic approach.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/275:1	The current problems in Afghanistan at the community level require a comprehensive solution, including not only military and security activities, but also political, development and economic activities.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/301:3	Importantly, in our view, the conference clearly emphasized the importance of Afghan leadership and, ultimately, ownership of efforts to address the key challenges facing Afghanistan - security, institutional incapacity, corruption and narcotics.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/171:5	To avoid a new wave of violence, both sides and the international community must act immediately.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/169:2	In order to restore real stability, a comprehensive and wide-ranging approach is needed, consisting of a wide range of legal, political, and international tools.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/208:1	We strongly condemn these practices as a flagrant violation of international covenants, laws and humanitarian norms. We call on the international community, the members of the Quartet and all actors to intervene immediately and firmly to compel Israel to put an end to such actions, which constitute a serious threat to security and stability in the Middle East region, as violence only begets violence, which could plunge the region into a spiral from which it will be difficult to emerge.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/246:3	This is especially true with regard to the political sphere and the security situation.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/265:2	In that regard, we are deeply concerned about the security situation in Afghanistan, which has deteriorated since last year as a result of the repressive activities of the remaining elements of the Taliban and Al-Qaida, conflicts among warlords and the narcotics trade.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/255:3	Somali leaders must work toward a political process that is open to all who are willing to renounce violent opposition.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/161:1	Global terrorism remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/189:4	UNMIK and KFOR's requests for information were met with a standard response from the KPC commander, who said that under his limited authority, he could not provide additional information.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/55:1	I would like to say something briefly about specific proposals in the revised organizational plan and how these proposals address those concerns.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/255:2	It is important to present the image and acceptance of the police in society as the primary law enforcement agency.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/42:2	Although these contacts have been constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the parties are expected to submit proposals on territory and security within 90 days, have yet to take place.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/151:4	While this is a good start, it will only be sustainable in the long term if the government makes complementary efforts to address other socio-economic challenges.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/68:2	We need peace to address other enormous challenges.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/163:1	Economic issues, such as investment, are also a major concern.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/235:1	In this context, Russia is convinced of the importance of developing a comprehensive international counter-narcotics strategy in Afghanistan, including the establishment of a security belt along the Afghan border.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/82:1	Sierra Leone is also experiencing a boom in investment in the extractive industry.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/69:2	Some of these countries face enormous challenges, and there will be setbacks as well as progress in the coming years.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/150:3	We urge the Government of Haiti to take strong action to prevent such violence and ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/249:1	Then, seven years later, the 2009 edition also noted that nearly 30 percent of youth in Arab countries were unemployed, more than 50 percent of the population was under the age of 24, and that 51 million new jobs needed to be created in 2020 to avoid an increase in the unemployment rate.	0
2010/s/pv_6297/58:7	These are issues that need to be addressed as part of security sector reform efforts.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/65:1	The Russian Federation once again calls on the Israeli and Palestinian sides to show restraint and responsibility and to reject unilateralism.	3
2009/s/pv_6111/53:1	I cannot emphasize enough the risk that the unavailability of military helicopters poses to the operational effectiveness of the force.	3
2004/s/pv_4952/83:2	"Some Iraqi interlocutors raised questions about the term - ""national reconciliation"" - in terms of what it entails and what it requires."	0
2009/s/pv_6236/52:4	As indicated in the report, the period under review witnessed significant achievements in the peace process and in preparations for the 2010 elections, despite some challenges.	0
2009/s/pv_6111/58:1	Beyond the UN Mission in Eastern Chad (MINURCAT) area of responsibility, other developments are also of concern.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/110:6	Representative democracy also requires citizens to have confidence in the governments they elect.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/165:1	Also, although the overall security situation has remained calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste officially assumed full responsibility for security on 20 May, smuggling, illicit trafficking and illegal border crossings should be seen as a cause for concern, as should tensions related to the demonstrations in Dili last July.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/126:2	The lack of such participation will prevent progress in addressing important issues of public administration and will make no progress in improving Kosovo's image in the minds of the wider community.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/58:1	Fortunately, the choices before the Iraqi people are not black and white; nor are they zero-sum options. There is a whole range of compromise gray areas that can address the core concerns of all participants in the political process.	0
2006/s/pv_5492/59:1	Despite our assessment that achieving a full ceasefire is difficult at this time, I continue to believe that the international community must make its position clear: the attacks must cease immediately, and Israel must make more credible efforts to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, while urgently working to create the conditions for a cessation of these attacks.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/271:1	The review of the security situation contained in the special report of the Secretary-General (S/2008/434) suggests that, despite the tireless efforts of the Afghan people and the international community, serious challenges to peace and stability in Afghanistan remain.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/188:3	The Trial Chamber's push for an arrest warrant for a head of state on March 4, 2009 triggered a major public backlash and set back hopes for peace and stability.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/379:1	Mr. Eide (spoke in English): I don't think specific questions have been asked, but perhaps I can make some comments.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/154:1	We are also concerned about the resurgence of cholera cases, although the death rate seems to be slowly decreasing.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/128:6	The camps have been closed, and IDPs are returning to normal life, although some issues remain and require an immediate response.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/121:2	Measures to overcome deficiencies should address both immediate needs and structural deficits.	0
2011/s/pv_6566/71:1	The Chair (spoke in French): I now give the floor to Ambassador José Moraes Cabral of Portugal in his capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) concerning the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/54:3	However, in 2007, after the arrest warrants for Harun and Kushayb were issued, President al-Bashir publicly refused to execute them, defying the authority of the Security Council and saying that Harun had done what he was ordered to do.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/110:2	The current political situation in Kosovo highlights realities that contradict these basic assertions, and we hope they are part of the educational process of democratic stabilization.	0
1999/s/pv_3969/39:3	In this context, the Council reaffirms that the main cause of the crisis in Angola is the refusal of UNITA to comply with the relevant basic provisions of the Lusaka Protocol Lusaka Protocol, and reiterates its demand that UNITA comply with its obligations to demilitarize and allow the extension of State administration to the territories under its control.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/115:1	Describing the unfortunate incident as malicious and unacceptable, the president emphasized that it is a potential outbreak of violence in the upcoming 2012 elections.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/191:3	As the presidential elections approach, it is even more necessary and urgent to improve the security situation.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/56:4	The MDC candidate has little or no access to the media in Zimbabwe; he is barred from campaigning freely; and campaign buses and cars have reportedly been seized by the state, allegedly due to illegal registration.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/149:1	Bosnia and Herzegovina is concerned about the current political stalemate in forming a new government and defining a clear constitutional reform process.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/105:4	We should acknowledge our great concern about the situation in Afghanistan.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/127:3	The UN's zero-tolerance policy should be emphasized, and there should be no impunity for those found guilty of these crimes.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/103:1	We have called on the Council on several occasions to take action to compel Israel to cease its military attacks, ensure the protection of the civilian population and stop all illegal punitive measures through which it is causing a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/255:1	Cuba once again comes to the Security Council to denounce and strongly condemn the complicity and absolute responsibility of the United States government for the release of this person.	3
2008/s/pv_5919/62:1	Africans have made their concerns about the situation in Zimbabwe very clear.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/171:2	Again, these challenges include national reconciliation, political power-sharing and the equitable distribution of natural resources, especially oil revenues.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/100:2	Moreover, the negative impact of the crisis is also being felt beyond Libya's borders and not just on the African continent.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/222:1	The European Union is deeply concerned by the ongoing cycle of retaliatory violence in Israel and the occupied territories.	3
2011/s/pv_6688/59:3	President al-Bashir took diplomatic retaliation against the Kenyan decision and threatened economic and trade sanctions.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/125:2	During those hearings, the Chinese delegation has always emphasized the view that the Darfur issue involves a political process, the deployment of peacekeepers, economic development, humanitarian assistance and justice. It is a very complex issue that requires a great deal of political wisdom to find a comprehensive solution that ensures peace and justice.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/195:4	While it is possible to overthrow a new leader in just a few months, building such a democratic society requires more time and sacrifices.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/72:4	If not, we can see more violent splits that can occur when people demand their rights, as there is no force to forcibly prevent them from giving them up.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/307:4	In that context, we believe it is critical that the Security Council pay the utmost attention to the threats posed by fundamentalist and extremist religious organizations such as Hizb ut-Tahrir and urge the Council to impose strong sanctions on terrorist organizations.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/56:1	It is with great concern that I must inform you of the escalation of criminal acts and attacks against United Nations and humanitarian personnel.	3
2007/s/pv_5683/68:2	In addition, Israeli air violations of the Blue Line have continued on a regular basis, in direct violation of resolution 1701 (2006).	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/87:1	The Brazilian government is closely following the Haitian government's efforts to undertake institutional reforms.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/134:2	In this regard, we take note of the statements made by the main elected representatives of Kosovo, who immediately condemned that crime and demanded that the perpetrators be brought to justice.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/88:1	In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I would like to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes so that the Council can conduct its work expeditiously.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/152:2	It is up to the people and leaders of the region to resist the calls of the demagogues, find compromises and build alliances, continue to trust their regimes even when they lose elections, and protect the principles and institutions that will ultimately protect them.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/284:2	We believe that Palestine will remain the biggest challenge in the Middle East.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/154:2	This directly relates to CTED's credibility.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/217:2	The international community must take the necessary action to prevent Israel from continuing the condemnable destruction it has embarked on in Gaza, and emphasize the rejection of all these Israeli practices, which are in violation of international law and international humanitarian law.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/154:2	As unexpected as it was, these changes prove an old rule of political science: Non-reform leads to revolution.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/194:5	This has been a source of constant concern for us.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/261:1	While resolving the six-decade-old Palestinian tragedy will have a major impact on the situation in the Middle East, peace in the region also requires progress on the other pillars of the peace process.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/114:3	This is also why I have deliberately avoided addressing other topics that some consider necessary when discussing the Middle East, such as the need to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or the situation in Syria, as we have addressed these issues in other meetings of the Council.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10:05 a.m.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/85:1	But we also oppose and condemn extrajudicial executions.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/141:3	We condemn all ethnically motivated acts and crimes committed in Kosovo.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/136:2	However, we do not believe that sovereignty requires the Security Council to stand idly by when governments massacre their own people, thereby threatening regional peace and security.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/149:1	No one in the region is exempt from the demands for change that we have witnessed.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/177:1	The security challenges coming from the Sahel-Saharan region are not new.	0
2006/s/pv_5466/51:3	Again, we received responses that seemed to justify our concerns.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/57:1	As the prosecutor, I will face any judicial challenge by President al-Bashir and other defendants at the court.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/202:2	We should avoid easy answers that claim that the Sahel has always faced such challenges, when it is well known that these challenges were not actually that great in the past.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/53:2	Due to increased violence, the Karni crossing was closed from May 15-20 and has only reopened sporadically since then.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/282:1	The nature of the terrorist threat varies across countries and regions, as do countries' counterterrorism capabilities and needs.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/266:1	The international guarantors of Timor-Leste's security, the International Stabilization Force (ISF) and the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), no longer face the challenges they did two or three years ago.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/419:3	Azerbaijan's refusal to engage in direct negotiations with the elected representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the main obstacles to the resolution of the conflict referred to by the representative of Azerbaijan.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/242:2	How to improve the security situation is undoubtedly the biggest challenge Iraq now faces. It will determine the future course of Iraq's political, economic and social development.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/64:1	The Secretary-General and his Special Coordinator for Lebanon issued statements strongly condemning Fatah al-Islam's criminal acts as attacks on Lebanon's stability and sovereignty.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/182:6	The United States is urging the United Nations and the Haitian National Police to redouble their efforts to screen students' personal records.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/143:1	When addressing the situation in Haiti within the UN framework, almost all attention is almost always focused on so-called security issues, which in practice minimizes the urgent attention needed to the country's serious structural, economic and social problems.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/159:1	Regarding the humanitarian situation, Guatemala is concerned that, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 20 million people in the Sahel region are in need of humanitarian assistance, particularly in Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/153:2	The first concerns the fight against impunity.	0
2009/s/pv_6236/74:1	Second, there is a risk that trust between the opposition and the ruling party will deteriorate.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/196:3	From that point of view, re-establishing peace, security and national unity are the first challenges to be addressed.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/129:1	We are also concerned about the very high rate of unemployment and widespread poverty in the country.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/147:3	To meet that challenge, a comprehensive, fully Afghan-owned approach is needed.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/125:1	My first comment relates to the situation on the ground, which is clearly of concern.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/317:1	Meeting these criteria requires transferring more powers and responsibilities to local authorities and accelerating privatization.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/55:3	After some initial hesitation, the party chose to resolve the issue within the framework of the law and the party's constitution and held new elections for party delegates.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/54:4	In our view, this process must be conducted in a way that allows all Afghans to participate equally in the elections, while taking into account the difficulties we face in terms of security.	0

2012/s/pv_6729/288:1	Third, the humanitarian situation in Somalia remains of concern.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/154:3	Adequate and timely resources are needed to sustain potentially long and complex processes.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/60:2	But we are concerned that the violence could cause part of the population to stay away from polling sites in the south and elsewhere.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/184:3	The Rome Statute, adopted earlier that year, was a huge step forward, incorporating sexual violence such as rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution and forced pregnancy, for the first time explicitly into an international legal framework. This was done in such a way as to make prosecution of perpetrators a practical possibility.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/283:1	Cholera remains a serious threat.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/47:2	Since the beginning of the political stalemate after the March 29 elections, the Secretary-General has expressed concern about the process and politically motivated violence.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/79:4	In other areas, however, progress has fallen short of expectations and many challenges remain.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/108:2	Progress has also been made in the areas of public administration and law enforcement.	0
2002/s/pv_4583/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 1.05 p.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/327:4	I believe our friends in UNAMA and our allies are well aware of what those requirements are.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/71:3	My government believes that not only are these actions contrary to international law, but that they undermine the concept of the rule of law, which is a key element in the fight against terrorism.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/143:2	Achieving peace, security and stability in that country requires getting rid of poverty and underdevelopment in the first place.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/261:2	However, much remains to be done, especially in the areas of rule of law, law enforcement, government capacity, development, the private sector, and the personal security of all Afghan citizens.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/107:1	We challenge anyone to say that there is now a single battle taking place in any corner of Sudan.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/75:3	Romania emphasizes once again that any act of terrorism is unacceptable and must be condemned.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/183:1	The French authorities are deeply concerned by the continued deterioration of the situation in the northern Gaza Strip over the past week.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/276:1	When I had the opportunity to address the Council on this issue in February (see S/PV.5130), I stated that the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, freedom of movement and decentralization were areas that needed special attention, given their direct link to the common goal of a democratic, multi-ethnic Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/157:3	The conference also reminded us of the difficult challenges that lie ahead.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/86:3	This disturbing pattern of activity is a serious concern that threatens to undermine the credibility of UN operations.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/172:2	That is why we condemn terrorism.	3
2010/s/pv_6444/52:1	"""The Security Council remains deeply concerned about the security situation in the Central African Republic."	3
2012/s/pv_6734/279:3	This is unacceptable and must be fully condemned, especially by the Security Council, using the means at its disposal.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/324:1	The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains a major concern.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 3:25 p.m.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/80:1	What everyone needs to do is reject the hardline voices that find comfort in the old ways and believe that it is impossible for Serbs and Albanians to normalize their relations by reaching a historic compromise.	3
2010/s/pv_6259/53:2	It is no longer possible to ignore the crisis, which has become a tougher challenge today than ever before.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/248:2	The first edition, published in 2002, noted that the lack of freedom in the Arab world undermined human development and was one of the most painful manifestations of underdeveloped political development.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/65:1	The situation along Lebanon's border with Syria remains alarming.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/120:2	But let's not kid ourselves: This is a challenge for all of Kosovo, not just one minority.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/103:3	Some of the accusations reported in the press are speculation and it is important that investigations are conducted with the necessary degree of calm.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/184:1	Somalis should take responsibility for their own security and develop their own judicial system to address threats to their security.	0
2002/s/pv_4583/49:1	"""The Security Council also expresses its concern about rising tensions in the Ituri region and calls on all parties to exercise restraint."	3
2011/s/pv_6579/65:4	Blue Nile State remains a concern for us.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/341:4	Therefore, UN counter-terrorism bodies should address these shortcomings with more seriousness and dedication.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/419:2	In fact, Azerbaijan itself is in violation of those resolutions, which urge the parties concerned to continue negotiations within the OSCE Minsk Group, as well as through various contacts among themselves.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/51:2	She expressed the deep concern of the Council and the Secretary-General about the recent increase in North-South tensions, as well as the continued lack of progress on Abyei and other post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues.	3

2012/s/pv_6734/58:4	I am deeply concerned about the recent escalation between Gaza and Israel.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/281:4	It is clear that these conditions represent the single greatest obstacle to stabilization and progress in Afghanistan and that these conditions, if allowed to continue, threaten to disrupt the progress made in nearly three years.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/127:1	Security and stability remain a major challenge.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/55:2	However, the operation also highlighted the challenges that Liberia's security sector still faces, especially in terms of logistics, communications, and the mobility of the police and immigration service.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/64:1	Pakistan is deeply concerned that the report concludes that the humanitarian and economic challenges facing the Sahel have been exacerbated by the fallout from the Libyan crisis.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/151:2	We particularly condemn any attempt to force UNAMA into any kind of so-called joint governance, as well as any interference with the sole authority of the Special Representative.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/298:4	We note that civil society organizations have expressed serious concerns in this regard.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/61:2	It is clear that all institutions of law and order in Iraq are facing serious challenges.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/65:1	Political pressure on UNMIK has increased significantly with attempts to challenge its role under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/253:5	There is no doubt today that the real intent was to prevent details of his senseless acts of destruction committed at the behest of the CIA from being made public.	3
2009/s/pv_6236/97:1	The Government also shares a number of the concerns expressed in the report regarding, inter alia, human rights and the situation of women and children.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/176:3	We have serious concerns about this law, as it could have far-reaching consequences.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/237:4	However, we believe that an abrupt withdrawal would be counterproductive and would create an unprecedented vacuum, especially given that the conditions conducive to the hoped-for large-scale investment and sustainable development have not yet been fully established.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/333:1	At the outset, I must express our grave concern about the security situation in this country.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/105:1	I have to say that the topic chosen for our discussion today is quite challenging, although it is an interesting one.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/185:3	As the Secretary-General's report (S/2004/634) makes clear, addressing the problem is a difficult challenge.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/162:1	However, my delegation notes with regret that the security situation remains of concern.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/67:3	I urge Hamas to heed these appeals.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/114:2	He reiterated his personal condemnation of the incident, which he described as sending the wrong and unwanted messages ahead of the 2012 elections, which could undermine and hinder the gains made in reshaping the image of the country and in building and consolidating peace, achieved with painstaking efforts, with the help of our development partners and the international community.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/93:1	Sadly, the current Palestinian leadership has proven to be as incapable of being a partner in peace as it is of pursuing reform and democratic governance for its people.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/163:1	First and foremost, security concerns remain paramount.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/101:6	In the case of Darfur, the conditions for such a mechanism are clearly not in place.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/86:1	First, while Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West Africa Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere hinders intelligence sharing and early warning.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/125:6	France strongly condemns these attacks and calls on all parties to exercise maximum restraint.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/53:5	The political debate is likely to heat up, as several election-related court challenges have already been filed.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/120:1	The report emphasizes the alarming picture of the situation in the Sahel and the related security, economic and humanitarian concerns.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/335:1	Secondly, Mr. Covic expressed concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority -- the Kosovo Serbs -- risk losing out to the mechanical majority vote. I would like to say that I think the most important aspect of democracy that can be expected is that one participates, exercises democratic rights and votes.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/308:1	We are deeply concerned about the plight of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/44:3	In Egypt, we have been calling for an early and peaceful transfer of power to a civilian government.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/144:3	The situation of minorities remains of concern, particularly with regard to freedom of movement and access to justice.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/219:1	We, again, condemn the killing of civilians both on the Palestinian side and on the Israeli side.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/134:1	Now the challenge of establishing local and regional administrations in areas recovered from al-Shabaab must be given top priority.	3
2005/s/pv_5243/35:1	Letter dated July 26, 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council	0
2010/s/pv_6353/207:2	We urge the parties to act with restraint and avoid provocative actions or statements that could trigger further violence.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/181:4	The United States urges the Haitian authorities to fulfill their pledge to fill all six vacancies on the Supreme Court by October 3, 2011.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/120:1	We are concerned that the success of the presidential election may risk being eroded by the lack of progress in forming a government.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/139:2	The challenges facing the country demand that Haiti's leaders have a common, unified will.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/65:1	However, the potential for a complete breakdown of law and order, as well as the collapse of the fragile economy and the disintegration of Palestinian self-government institutions, remains.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/128:4	The negative impact of the Libyan situation will only grow, threatening the continued peace and stability of the region. China expresses its deep concern in this regard.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/73:1	One thing that remains of great concern to me is that efforts by Liberians to rebuild their judicial system will take a long time, so the system itself is likely to remain weak and porous in the short term.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/78:6	In 1993, that vision was hazy at best, and at the time, it was impossible to identify an end goal that would come close to meeting the concerns of both peoples.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/255:1	We have noted the caution shown by the Secretary-General and the technical assessment mission with regard to security sector reform, particularly with regard to the PNTL.	3
2011/s/pv_6688/74:2	As I explained, I am confident that your esteemed council will not pay attention to these false accusations, which are not true and do not meet the minimum standards of professionalism.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/96:1	We took note of the concern about the implementation of the joint statement of April 2, 2009, referred to in the report.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/62:2	This raised serious tensions with local communities, as well as threats to the UN mission by some former CNDP military commanders now integrated into the Congolese army.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/140:2	We consider any departure from that principle to be unacceptable, not to mention that the fragile situation in the region could lead to widespread instability.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/61:2	Haiti's political and civil society leaders continue to call for national consensus in key areas, such as the national budget, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and constitutional reform.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/216:1	The Jordanian government emphasizes the need for the Israeli government to immediately and completely cease all violence and destruction in the Gaza Strip and throughout the occupied Palestinian territories, end the policy of destroying Palestinian infrastructure and homes, stop extrajudicial killings and collective punishment of the Palestinian people, and put an end to the violations practiced by Israel against the Palestinian people.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/153:5	However, we remain concerned that there is an overemphasis on visits to developing countries.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/320:2	As UNAMA, we would be irresponsible if we did not appeal to the international community, the government of Pakistan, the government of Afghanistan and its national forces to end this situation, especially on the southern border.	3
2006/s/pv_5492/55:3	While Hezbollah's actions are regrettable, and as I said Israel has the right to defend itself, the use of excessive force is to be condemned.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/108:1	Pakistan's new democratic government has inherited a daunting legacy of political, economic and security challenges.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/234:4	Further development of the situation in this direction could jeopardize efforts to reform and build the country and, in the long run, threaten peace and stability throughout the region.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/171:5	We have also fenced off 25 kilometers of the border and installed floodlights and video cameras at border crossings.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/45:2	As Council members are aware, migration from north to south has begun, and for the first time, it will involve crossing an international border.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/67:4	It would not be in the interest of the Palestinian people to challenge the basic pillars of Palestinian legitimacy and national aspirations.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/61:1	The situation in Syria is of deep and growing concern to the United Nations.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/173:2	We are particularly concerned about the lack of mid-level training for civil servants, as well as the significant issues that still surround the judicial sphere.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/98:1	The recent rulings by an Indonesian appellate court, overturning four criminalization rulings by the Ad Hoc Human Rights Court, while falling outside the Mission's mandate, have a direct impact on the larger issue of accountability for crimes.	3
2009/s/pv_6236/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10:55 a.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/58:1	I am particularly concerned about the instability that could arise if the political and socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/285:3	However, what is needed is an American will to prioritize peace in the Middle East, overcoming the seven years of neglect and absenteeism that have exacerbated the situation in the region.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/48:5	However, these were not so serious as to jeopardize the process. The simplicity of the logistics makes it difficult to successfully vote twice on election day.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/198:3	We are also concerned about the situation of those involved in the reconstruction of the country.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/112:2	We are deeply concerned that leaders of groups such as the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) continue to refuse to participate in the talks.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/46:2	The Council condemns all unilateral actions intended to create facts on the ground that jeopardize the outcome of the negotiations.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/41:3	The Council emphasizes that all those responsible for violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, as well as those who ordered the commission of such acts, will be held accountable.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/114:4	"Statements such as ""the Palestinian people don't love their children"" or ""the Palestinian people send their children to die because they hate Israel"" are racist and reflect the kind of attitude that should be rejected outright - and I'm trying to do that right now."	3
2004/s/pv_5025/176:4	Shifting blame, finding scapegoats to take responsibility for failure in Afghanistan and asking those who are already doing more to do more are unfair, unacceptable and ultimately demoralizing.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/108:2	We cannot send the message that terrorists will be safe, and settle for the usual condemnations.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/91:4	Many achievements have been made, but many challenges lie ahead.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/124:5	The recent fatwa issued by the Ulema Council condemning narcotics and other related activities could be very useful in thwarting opium poppy production.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/286:3	We urge Council members and the Group of Friends of Haiti to take a positive view of these recommendations made by the Secretary-General.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/113:4	It seems that people not only aspire to, but demand that pluralistic and more representative governments provide tangible benefits to their citizens.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/122:1	Timor-Leste continues to face important challenges in reducing poverty and creating jobs, especially for its young population.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/152:3	In light of recent experiences, it is also clear that the court will continue to face some serious challenges.	0
2009/s/pv_6236/59:1	Another election-related challenge is the large number of potential voters who cannot afford the administrative costs of obtaining a national ID card.	0
2011/s/pv_6544/47:2	The Council demands that the Government of Sudan immediately withdraw from the Abyei area.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/126:1	Security sector reform remains one of the key challenges to long-term peace and stability.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/174:1	Uganda believes that ending impunity is the only credible deterrent against crimes that are of serious concern to the international community.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/153:3	We are deeply concerned that if all sides do not exercise a strong will to stop acts of terrorism and violence, the peace process will not succeed.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/135:1	We note that in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/269:1	Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continuation of illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/201:3	We are therefore disappointed that the Secretary-General's report (S/2011/540) recommended only a partial reduction of the troop increase.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/215:3	Now, what Afghanistan has achieved is being eroded by serious challenges to the country's security and stability.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/111:1	While piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a critical challenge, we call on the international community not to lose sight of the fact that the solution to that issue must be achieved on land, not at sea. A comprehensive solution to the Somali conflict must address all the root causes of piracy and other challenges, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic waste.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/148:1	The second point I would like to highlight today is our ongoing concern for the well-being of the innocent people in Gaza and in the towns and cities in southern Israel.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/364:5	Finally, the Afghan leadership must combat narcotics.	3
2006/s/pv_5492/53:3	I also condemn Hezbollah's reckless disregard for the wishes of Lebanon's elected government and the interests of the Lebanese people and the wider region.	3
2007/s/pv_5798/43:1	"""The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks that took place in Algiers on December 11, 2007, near the Supreme Court and United Nations offices, resulting in a large number of deaths and injuries, and expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims of this heinous act of terrorism and their families, and to the people and Government of Algeria."	3
2004/s/pv_5049/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 4:05 p.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/71:1	I also remember how unacceptable it was for Israelis to talk about the 1967 borders, and for a long time it was almost unthinkable to suggest evacuating Israeli settlements.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/155:1	The Secretary-General's recent report on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) clearly expressed the importance of disarming Hezbollah and ending arms smuggling across the Lebanese-Syrian border.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/228:2	Needless to say, there are no ongoing patterns of sexual violence in Kenya today, and none of the activities reported for Kenya took place during the period covered by the current reporting period 2010-2011.	0
2002/s/pv_4597/4:1	"""At its 4597th meeting, held in private on August 8, 2002, the Security Council considered the item entitled `The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo'."	0
2008/s/pv_5930/109:1	I expressed my condemnation of the terrorist attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/260:2	We are concerned about the increase in insurgent activity in some parts of Afghanistan.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/116:2	In fact, more than half of the African issues on the Council's agenda concern the countries of the Great Lakes region - Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, northern Uganda, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/361:1	Today's discussion addresses a pressing issue.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/200:3	It is important to formally prosecute cases of domestic violence and sexual assault in accordance with the new penal code.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/188:5	This may be due to a sense of urgency as well as to the Council's own limitations as an intergovernmental political body that is primarily executive in nature.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/245:2	It also calls on Israel, the occupying power, to abide by the rules of international law, the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, as well as the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/133:2	States cannot flout this fundamental obligation without any consequences for their unlawful behavior.	3
2007/s/pv_5683/70:2	I had hoped that the new coordinator would be with us today, but the Secretary-General has urgently dispatched him to the region.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/180:2	My country has repeatedly expressed its concern for the civilian population in that area and considers it important that UNAMA deploy there to protect them.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/139:1	The incident in northern Mitrovica has clearly demonstrated that EULEX, despite the Security Council mandate regarding the reconfiguration of UNMIK, is increasingly moving away from the principle of status-neutrality, undermining the status of the existing international presence.	3
2001/s/ac_26/2001/28/412:1	KD 152 per person x 837 workers x 7 months/17 months = KD 52,387	0
