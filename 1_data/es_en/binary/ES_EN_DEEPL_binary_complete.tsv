"The deterioration of the population's standard of living is of concern as a result of the difficulties that had to be faced in 2008, particularly due to the global food crisis and the scourge of hurricanes that devastated the island."	1
"However, they also expressed concern that every time there is a sign of hope in the Middle East there is an escalation of violence and destruction."	1
"In particular, I would like to emphasize that the Taliban -- as your report concludes -- remain a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and containing them is an essential aspect."""	1
"However, the country continues to face challenges in its struggle to achieve stability and development, including the security situation, the worsening humanitarian situation, challenges in the areas of rule of law and human rights, and the incessant violence that has resulted in civilian deaths, which continues to increase."	1

The Secretary General unequivocally warns that none of the eight standards have been fully met to date.	1
"We categorically condemn this morning's ruthless attack on the shrines of Imam Ali al-Hadi and Imam Hassan al-Askari in Samarra, and share the outrage of the Iraqi people over this crime, which is another deliberate attempt by Al-Qaida to sow dissension and pit religious currents against each other in Iraq."	1
"This means that the secessionists continue to flagrantly disregard international law, thus rejecting the universal principles of the United Nations Charter."	1
We emphasize the tragic consequences that these messages have had recently in other parts of the continent.	1
"However, make no mistake: my country is also prepared to resist unceasingly the unilateral declaration of independence as long as a compromise solution is not in sight."	1

We highlight the issue of violence to express our impatience with the urgency of finding satisfactory solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	1
I am concerned that this vote and stalemate in Parliament could undermine the important gains that Somali stakeholders and their partners have made.	1
"In all these conversations, I was encouraged to find a convergence of views: we all marveled at the many advances Liberia has made since the fighting ended in 2003, but we all fully realized how daunting the challenges Liberia still faces are and that, ultimately, we can take nothing for granted."	1
"Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian Special Court process, additional remedial action would be necessary to ensure that justice is done."	1

"In his public statements, Colonel Khaddafi and his family members have continued to threaten citizens with civil war and the possibility of mass killings if protests continue."	1
"The Council condemns all attacks perpetrated by local and foreign armed groups that threaten the population, and endanger the peace and stability of the Central African Republic and the sub-region, including the attacks against Birao perpetrated by the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace on July 19 and November 24."	1
"The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon -- which was certified by this Council six years ago -- would result in security along its northern border, find themselves under constant rocket attacks by Hezbollah, which are penetrating deeper into Israeli territory every day."	1
"There has been an increase in the number of attacks against national and international security forces, officials of public institutions and humanitarian personnel. There has been an increase in the number of attacks against polling stations and threats against registration teams."	1
"This was made clear in the recent incidents of DIS indiscipline, namely the alleged killing of a civilian by a DIS commander in Farchana on March 22."	1
We note that the enduring challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	1
"At the same time, my delegation believes that the elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, in particular the Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their electorate if they adopted a more participatory attitude, instead of withdrawing from the legislature when faced with a difficult situation."	1
We should not underestimate the threat posed in Afghanistan by the destabilizing activities of the Taliban and Al-Qaida.	1
"Although neither side seems willing to return to war, there is a worrying pattern of escalating tension and destabilization that could lead to a full-scale confrontation and endanger civilian lives."	1

Recent events in the region confirm the concerns consistently conveyed to the mission by its interlocutors.	1
We have also noted that the spiral of violence has driven entire populations to move to escape the violence.	0
Such acts are absolutely unacceptable. The Palestinian Authority must stop these attacks and prosecute the perpetrators.	1
"During our previous debate, Belgium shared the concern expressed by the Secretary General about the dangers of violence in Iraq for a society, institutions and a political process that remain fragile."	1
We urge the Palestinian Authority to do everything possible to put an end to these attacks.	1
"In conclusion, while Timor-Leste has made significant progress, it still faces many serious challenges in its efforts to establish a stable democracy and develop its economy."	0
The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees of its security as a state.	1
This is obviously because the States in question rejected their measures.	1
"It is important to give women, who are the first victims of violence in all its manifestations, a leading role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and it is even more important and urgent to do so in the process of conflict prevention."	1

They insist on treating the case as a simple immigration crime.	1
I repeat today what I said last January 31 (see S/PV.6710) it is unacceptable to prevent the Council from assuming its responsibilities.	1
Your mission represents the last chance to prevent a crisis from erupting in Syria.	0
"All this occurred despite repeated condemnations of such inhumane acts in Council Resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), resolutions that became beacons of hope for millions of abused women and girls around the world."	1
"The second is to call once again, as a matter of urgency, for the Security Council to take indispensable measures to stop the bloodshed in Syria."	1
"In the face of this clear situation of threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without the double standards that characterize it in this matter and adopt, urgently and decisively, the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the countries that make up the Arab Group."	1
"The President: In accordance with standard practice, I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously."	0
"In our view, it is not infiltration across borders that is resulting in extremist violence in Afghanistan, including in the south and southeast."	0
The meeting was called to order at 4:10 p.m.	0
"The report before us makes for difficult reading, but it also sets out a challenge."	0
"In conclusion, in the context of world peace and the Middle East, I would like to emphasize that, while we understand all the different needs that emanate from security, it would be better for that region and for the whole world if the Iran situation could be prevented from escalating into a conflict, because it would be the kind of conflict that would have very unfortunate repercussions for the world and could be the straw that breaks the camel's back -- as the proverb says -- of world peace."	0
"We are deeply concerned that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated by one side against the other, despite the fact that the international community and the Security Council have made it clear that they abhor this situation."	1
"In order to complete the transfer process, a number of logistical requirements must be met."	0
"Given its current political status, Kosovo remains far from foreign direct investment and is not eligible to benefit from International Monetary Fund and World Bank programs and assistance, which would have a direct impact on the development of a stable and efficient economy."	0
This is an important step in the right direction.	0
"In addition, tensions on the border could lead to serious violence during the migration period, particularly in the Abyei area, from which neither side has fully withdrawn."	0
"This would entail stronger measures regarding the eviction of those who, with the threat of violence, are using Serbian property illegally."	0
"The first is that the demands for human rights and freedom are universal and will spread by themselves over time, as they are fundamental human aspirations."	0
"We urge all Member States to take immediate action to comply with the obligation contained in resolution 2036 (2012) to prohibit trade in Somali charcoal, particularly by those elements most active in such trade."	1
"Israel has legitimate security concerns, but these can only be fully and effectively addressed through a negotiated agreement."	0
"At the same time, we are concerned about the observation in the report that the work on demarcation of the land border between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is not being carried out expeditiously."	0
"This is important to strengthen the Mission's capacity to provide genuine protection to the Congolese civilian population, victims of an obvious humanitarian disaster, as Mr. Doss emphasized, and of massive human rights violations, in particular acts of violence directed against women and children."	1
"Given its role as a country at the forefront of these efforts, the United Kingdom knows, perhaps better than others around this table, how immense the long-term challenge of counter-narcotics is."	0
That is why I have focused more on the opportunities than on the challenges in my speech.	0
Measures that could undermine confidence or damage the outcome of negotiations should be suspended and reversed.	1
"The siege must be lifted immediately so that the civilian population in Gaza can have access, essentially to water, jobs, commerce, medical care and education, in short, access to their basic needs."	1

We are gravely concerned that the special processes created for this purpose seem to have failed.	1
"However, the challenges involved will be much greater, as they will be one-day events, and logistics will be hampered by Liberia's heavy rainy season."	0
"The Chad experience, however, left a strong imprint on our peacekeeping forces and a greater awareness of the challenge facing the United Nations in this regard."	0

National security forces are not yet able to respond to these threats in remote areas due to their limited capacity.	0
"The important challenges and problems related to security and national reconciliation should not be underestimated and, in my opinion, require the political attention of the Council."	0
"In compliance with these resolutions, this body should demand that the Government of the United States immediately try Luis Posada Carriles for his terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose justice system has been demanding his extradition for years."	1
"The Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations should make more efforts in prevention activities, such as the provision of drinking water and sanitation."	1
"The Security Council expresses grave concern over reports of an unusual and sudden influx of thousands of Misseriya into the city of Abyei and its environs, a phenomenon that could force major changes in the ethnic composition of the area."	1
We must now expedite the work related to our mutual obligations.	0

The mission requirements with respect to resolution 1325 (2000) were more specific and detailed during the deployment of the EU military operation than during the subsequent deployment of MINURCAT.	0
"As serious and reprehensible as this act was, it was an isolated act."	0
"Conflicts in the region have complex root causes involving multiple factors, such as political differences, unequal distribution of economic resources and tribal clashes.

This is an international obligation that States must comply with in order to help bring justice to the victims of these painful events.	1
Council members should know that all necessary measures have been and will continue to be taken to arrest the culprits as quickly as possible.	0
"Not only is the timetable for the next elections already approaching, but the situation on Liberia's border with Côte d'Ivoire is also becoming necessary to monitor closely for possible security implications."	0

"First of all, let me emphasize the importance of taking as a basis the current negotiations, both the Israeli-Palestinian track and the Israeli-Syrian track."	0

We note that efforts to reform local government have faced delays.	0
Violence and displacement are an immediate challenge to the credibility of the voting process.	0
The fight against impunity is also of utmost importance in the prevention of sexual violence.	0
These activities undermine the weak foundations of the Afghan state and hinder the achievement of lasting stability.	0
"At this stage of the peacebuilding process such behavior could be misinterpreted and incite violence, which could lead to a relapse into conflict."	0
The challenge now is to build on that platform and make the promise of peace a reality.	0

"At the same time, Cuba expresses its condemnation of the suicide bombings and other acts directed against Israeli civilians, innocent victims of the spiral of violence caused by the policy of its Government, while opposing the manipulation of such isolated acts to question the exercise of legitimate self-defense by the Palestinian people, and to justify actions, both selective and large-scale, against the Palestinian population."	1
"First, it is important to take into account two equally legitimate desires: on the one hand, the demand of minorities to live in security, to have equal opportunities for economic development and equal access to social services and education, and to exercise the right of return; on the other hand, the desire of the majority of the population to exercise their right to self-determination."	0

"We could go on mentioning widespread poverty, natural resource management problems, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, to which must be added thousands of ex-combatants waiting to be reintegrated, weak and unreformed security sectors, massive human rights violations and many other threats that could instigate a new conflict."	1
"In this sense, we believe that destructive measures aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be categorically condemned."	1
"While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has blamed the other for provoking the incident."	1
"We also wish to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents could lead to a situation of instability in the region that would hinder a peaceful solution to the situation in Kosovo, acceptable to the parties."	1
Israel must also refrain from taking unilateral actions in Jerusalem that disrupt the status quo or undermine trust.	1
"Organized crime, deeply rooted in political and social life, together with extremism, jeopardize the very foundations of the principles and values we are trying to instill in the new institutions that have been formed there and render our efforts may prove futile."	1
"As a result, the boundaries of security threats in many countries within and outside Africa, including members of this Council, have been overstepped, exposing their vulnerabilities."	1
"In addition to humanitarian difficulties, the situation raises security concerns."	0
"As we have always stressed, this position does not imply any kind of value judgment on the merits of the issue; it is a resolute invitation to give justice and the political process a chance."	0
"However, the task is achievable, provided that we set principled but realistic objectives and move towards them with deliberate action, as long as we are not alone in taking those actions."	0
"In order to make the best use of the time available to us and to allow as many delegations as possible to take the floor, I will not invite speakers one by one to take their seats at the table or to reoccupy the seat reserved for them at the side of the room."	0
"Failure to comply with its Charter obligations should have consequences for any Member State, and Sudan should be no exception."	1
"As I have stressed on many occasions, the lasting security and stability of any country, including Timor-Leste, can only be achieved through corresponding socio-economic development."	0
"We believe that Somalia faces a challenge comparable to that of a marathon runner, as the drafting of the constitution must be completed by April 20, which must then be adopted on May 22."	1
The impunity of these high-ranking officials is unacceptable and prevents post-conflict communities from recovering in a sustainable manner.	1
The Afghan authorities and the international community must make it clear that such behavior is unacceptable.	1
"To date, Pristina has rejected any such initiative."	1
"In this regard, the measures taken to address the serious problems in the prison system are encouraging, despite the serious problems that remain."	0
"Although the President acted in accordance with his constitutional prerogatives, I expressed concern that the pardon granted on December 25, 2009 could exacerbate perceptions of impunity."	1
"The Arab Spring confirms history's warning that when governments respond with an iron fist to the irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands and invincible hopes of their citizens, they are ultimately doomed to failure."	0
The progress made - and there is no doubt that there has been progress - must be seen in the context of the challenges Kosovo has faced.	0
"First, they have created a permanent humanitarian emergency situation which, in turn, threatens the peace and stability of Haiti."	1
Building an effective Somali judicial capacity will also enable Somalis to combat the scourge of terrorism and piracy.	0
"It is clear that our collective efforts require considerable resources and greater integration, a fact that is reflected in the results of the conferences held in Bucharest and Paris."	0
"For this reason Greece has insisted on the need to clarify, in the sixth preambular paragraph, in which the Council urges ""progress towards the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement"", that it should be reiterated that such negotiations have to take place between the two communities."	1
"In that regard, we want to go further and say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to empower the Somali security forces to control the most violent insurgents and to enable the government to expand its areas of authority as much as possible if peace negotiations fail."	1
"In his report, the Secretary General notes that some progress has been made in most of these areas, except for the key issue of local government reform and, in particular, decentralization, where progress is comparatively insufficient."	1
The Court's intervention is called upon to be the catalyst for decisive national and international action to respond to the challenges of justice in conflict situations.	0
"Some concerns have been expressed about the fairness of the census, most recently by several presidential candidates."	1
"To continue in this fight, the international community needs to make a greater contribution and pay more attention to this important aspect of the fight against terrorism."	1
Somalia's long-term security and stability will require a reliable and effective justice system.	0
The meeting was called to order at 13:00 hours.	0
"It is a difficult transition, which requires patience and persistence."	0
My delegation strongly condemns these acts of violence and expresses its condolences to the family of the deceased pediatrician.	1
"In return, the Belgrade authorities should end the obstructionist tactic that prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo's public institutions. The ""empty chair policy"" carries a great risk, the risk that Kosovo's history will be written without Kosovo Serbs."	1
The Haitian National Police will need to be adequately resourced to carry out its constitutional law enforcement functions.	0
"At the same time, I can understand the need for the international community to direct its attention and resources to other trouble spots around the world."	0
We are particularly concerned about the uncontrolled proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond as a result of the conflict.	1
This would truly demonstrate that the United Nations counter-terrorism efforts are global in nature and that Member States are united.	0
This is a complex challenge for Sahelian countries and regional organizations.	0
We call on Israel to take further steps to remove settler outposts in accordance with the roadmap and address the growing threat of settler extremism.	1
"Indeed, a stronger United Nations presence is vital, but for the added value of our Organization to be fully exploited, the necessary means will have to be made available, both in terms of personnel and security, as Mr. Eide reminded us a few minutes ago."	1
"Regarding the military aspects of security sector reform, the government has made it clear that it wishes to rely heavily on bilateral aid to increase the military's capabilities."	1
"In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the lack of progress in terms of freedom of movement for minorities, sustainable returns and meaningful representation of minorities in government structures and in the public sector in general."	1
My Government is grateful for the many expressions of condemnation and outrage that this atrocity has provoked. We are especially grateful for the Security Council's swift reaction to this gruesome crime.	1
"Indeed, because there is a history of foreign interference in the region, such recommendations will not only be suspect in the eyes of various segments of society, but may also have the potential to exacerbate the problem."	1
"Above all, we were most concerned about the insistence of the authorities in Pristina to somehow implement the so-called strategy for the northern part of Kosovo, in flagrant contravention of resolution 1244 (1999), which is the main international legal platform for resolving the Kosovo issue."	1
"Members of the Council have before them document S/2005/745, which contains the text of a letter dated 7 December 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the report of the Panel of Experts on Liberia."	0
"In particular, we would like to express our deep concern about the stagnation of socioeconomic development levels in Haiti and its food security."	1
"However, it should be noted that without a strong justice and security sector, the country's flourishing peace and stability could be threatened."	1
"The international community has clearly stated its strong condemnation of these acts through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Group of Friends of Syria, which has a wide and abundant participation."	1
"The five or six incidents in the border areas, at least those reported, have occurred in Nangarhar and Zabul, near the border with Pakistan."	0
"This is a matter of the utmost urgency, as Kenya can no longer bear the burden of this situation."	0
It is clear that the Executive Directorate must not slacken its efforts to achieve these objectives.	0
"The threat to security and stability in Afghanistan posed by terrorists, criminals and those involved in the illicit drug trade is real and must be addressed on an ongoing basis."	1
We hope that by the end of this year the instruments for more effective law enforcement in the field of counter-narcotics will be in place.	0
"We condemn all acts of terrorism perpetrated in Afghanistan, especially the most recent one that took place at the Indian Embassy in Kabul, and express our condolences to the governments and peoples of the affected countries, as well as to the families of the victims."	1
"The collection of timely, accurate, reliable and objective information on conflict-related sexual violence is critical to tailoring the Council's responses, as well as to enhancing action to prevent sexual violence."	1
"The true establishment of the rule of law in the DRC requires the formation of an effective and democratic army, judicial system and police force."	1
"The international community should -- including through the auspices of the United Nations -- use diplomatic leverage and facilitate, among other things, technical assistance in areas such as political, security and justice sector reform; the drafting of new constitutions and legal frameworks; and the development of electoral institutions and the conduct of elections."	1
The ongoing instability in the Sahel has implications beyond the countries most directly affected.	0
It calls for adherence to international law and for the parties to fulfill their obligations and the roadmap to achieve the vision of two states living side by side in peace and security.	1
"We cannot run the risk that the financial and human effort made so far in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be lost in the face of citizen frustration and, eventually, the crisis and conflict will resurface."	0
The Board would be failing in its duty if it did not use these tools when circumstances so require.	0
"In these conditions, where profound inequalities and political, economic and social exclusion converge, a process of transformation of the prevailing order is emerging in search of economic and political changes and alternatives for participation and openness to new spaces and mechanisms of expression that imply, in short, the vindication of fundamental rights."	1
ISAF troops must fully implement their mandate to eradicate threats emanating from Afghanistan.	1
"In my delegation's view, in order to prevent further outbreaks of violence and instability in the northern region of Kosovo, it remains essential that the reconciliation process be accompanied by policies aimed at ensuring the socio-economic stability of communities in a non-discriminatory manner."	1
"Withholding that level of funding would cripple any government, and a fortiori an authority in occupied territory. If the funds are not immediately released, it will jeopardize the achievements of state-building, including further good governance that would benefit the Palestinian people and the development of security forces defending law and order in the West Bank."	1
"As Council members know better than anyone, the Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the greatest diplomatic challenges the world has faced since the mid-20th century. At the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a dispute with competing and contradictory historical narratives, collective aspirations and identities."	0
Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a common concern of all members of the United Nations and of the international community at large.	1
"Naturally, this causes growing concern among the population and causes some to question the over-reliance on the military option."	0
"However, there is a serious danger that, as a result of this decision, which violates the documents of the Bonn and Berlin conferences, the country will face an explosive situation characterized by a new armed resistance and by the internal division of the power structures."	1
Finding a starting point for discussions on the outstanding challenges facing Middle Eastern societies and finding potential opportunities arising from these problems could be an onerous task.	0
"Addressing the causes of economic failure requires ongoing projects based on sound trade and economic principles, especially given the region's strategic location within the African continent and the fact that it has a wealth of natural resources."	0
"They have taken all these actions, and then they ask for protection and guarantees and use these arguments to continue to extort more concessions from us."	1
"Since the publication of the report, there has been a significant increase in attention devoted to the situation on Liberia's border with Côte d'Ivoire."	0
"When assessing that progress, it is important to recognize how far Timor-Leste has come in the few years since independence, but just as important to acknowledge the significant challenges that still need to be addressed."	0
I would also like to point out the active Arab diplomacy in preparation for the conference.	0
"The prohibition of illegal cross-border movement is vital in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling."	1
"Of course, there are those who are uncomfortable with what they see as an excessive and, indeed, negative concern for ethnic balance."	0
"Despite the fact that almost 80% of the Afghan population is directly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods, only a very small amount of money has been allocated to this sector of the economy."	0
"Unless addressed by the Government, these problems could pose serious threats to the security and stability of Timor-Leste."	1
"However, prevention will only be effective if peacekeeping operations have the necessary resources to carry out their mandate."	0
The Palestinian Authority's ability to build reliable institutions and a security infrastructure capable and willing to fight terrorism and other threats is a key element for the creation of a Palestinian state and a legitimate expectation on the part of Israel.	0
"It is clear that definitive progress in these areas will require further concerted efforts on the part of the international community, as well as Belgrade and the Kosovars."	0
Viet Nam is of the view that the diverse nature of violence against women and girls requires a comprehensive approach.	0
"The current problems of Afghan communities require a comprehensive solution, not strictly limited to military and security activities, but also encompassing political, economic and developmental activities."	0
"In our view, it is important that the Conference clearly underlined the importance of Afghan leadership and, ultimately, ownership of efforts to address the key challenges facing Afghanistan: security, lack of institutional capacity, corruption and narcotics."	0
"To prevent a new wave of violence, both sides and the international community must act promptly."	1
"In order to restore real stability, a detailed and far-reaching approach is needed, including a comprehensive set of legal, political and international tools."	0
"We strongly condemn such practices, which constitute a flagrant violation of international norms and humanitarian law. We therefore urge the international community, the Quartet and all other stakeholders to intervene immediately and decisively to demand that Israel cease such acts, which pose a grave threat to peace and security in the Middle East region. Violence only breeds violence. The region will be trapped in a vicious circle from which it will be difficult to escape."	1
This is particularly true with respect to the political sphere and the security situation.	0
"In this regard, we are very concerned about the prevailing security situation in Afghanistan, which has been deteriorating since last year as a result of the subversive activities of the remaining Taliban and Al-Qaida elements, warlord clashes and narcotics trafficking."	1
Somali leaders must work toward a political process that is open to all those willing to reject violent opposition.	1
International terrorism remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.	0
"When UNMIK and KFOR requested data about the Army's presence in the KPC, they received a very typical response from the KPC commander, who said that, given his limited competencies, he could not provide further information."	1
Let me briefly address the specific proposals contained in the revised organizational plan and how these concerns are addressed.	0
It is important for the police to have community outreach and acceptance as the primary law enforcement agency.	0
"While this is constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the parties would be expected to present territorial and security proposals within 90 days, are still not taking place."	1
"While this is a good starting point, its long-term sustainability will only be achieved if the government deploys complementary efforts to address other socioeconomic problems."	0
We need peace to be able to deal with other equally Dantesque challenges.	0
"Economic issues, and in particular investment, are also of deep concern."	0
"In this context, Russia is convinced of the importance of developing a comprehensive international counter-narcotics strategy, including the establishment of a security belt along the Afghan borders."	0
Sierra Leone is also experiencing increased investment in the extractive sector.	0
"Some of these countries face enormous challenges, and there will be setbacks and progress in the coming years."	0
We urge the Government of Haiti to take strong measures to prevent such violence and to ensure that those responsible for such acts are brought to justice.	1
"Subsequently, seven years later, in the 2009 edition, it was further noted that approximately 30% of young people in Arab countries were unemployed, that more than 50% of the population was under 24 years of age, and that 51 million new jobs needed to be created by 2020 to avoid an increase in the unemployment rate."	0
These issues must be addressed within the framework of security sector reform.	0
"Once again the Russian Federation urges the Israeli and Palestinian sides to show restraint and a high level of responsibility, and to refuse unilateralism."	1
I cannot overemphasize the risk that the lack of military helicopters poses to the operational effectiveness of the force.	1
Some of our Iraqi interlocutors asked what exactly the term national reconciliation meant and what it required.	0
"As outlined in the report, the period under review saw significant progress in the peace process as well as in the preparations for the 2010 elections, although some challenges remain."	0
"Beyond MINURCAT's area of responsibility in eastern Chad, other developments are also cause for concern."	1
"Likewise, representative democracy requires that citizens have confidence in the governments they elect."	0
"In addition, while the overall security situation has remained calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste officially assumed full security responsibility on May 20, smuggling, illegal trade and border crossings, as well as tensions following demonstrations in Dili in July, should be considered a cause for concern."	1
"The lack of participation in these institutions impedes progress on specific public administration issues, and does not contribute to improving Kosovo's international image."	1
"Fortunately, the choices before the people of Iraq are not black and white, nor are they zero-sum. There is a whole middle range of compromise that can accommodate the essential concerns of all participants in the political process."	0
"Notwithstanding our assessment that a full ceasefire is difficult to achieve at this time, I remain of the view that the international community must make clear its position on the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for Israel to make a much greater and more reliable effort to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure while the conditions for such a cessation are established as a matter of urgency."	1
"The review of the security situation contained in the Secretary-General's special report (S/2008/434) suggests that, despite the tireless efforts of the Afghan people and the international community, serious challenges to peace and stabilization in Afghanistan remain."	0
"On March 4, he urged the issuance of arrest warrants for state officials, provoking popular outrage and undermining hopes for peace and stability."	1
"Mr. Eide: I don't think I have been asked any questions, but I would like to make a few remarks."	0
"We are also concerned about the resurgence of cholera cases, although the mortality rate appears to be slowly declining."	1
"Tent camps have been closed and internally displaced persons are returning to normal life, although some problems remain that require a rapid response."	0
Measures to overcome these deficiencies must address both immediate needs and structural deficits.	0
"The President (spoke in French): I now give the floor to Ambassador Jose Filipe Moraes Cabral of Portugal, in his capacity as Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya."	0
"However, in 2007, after the issuance of the arrest warrants against Harun and Kushayb, President Al-Bashir publicly rejected their implementation, challenged the authority of the Security Council and declared that Harun had done what he had been ordered to do."	1
The current political situation in Kosovo reflects realities that run counter to these basic premises; we hope that this is only part of the learning process of democratic stabilization.	0
"In this context, it reaffirms that the root cause of the crisis in Angola is UNITA's refusal to comply with the basic provisions of the Lusaka Protocol and reiterates its demand that UNITA abide by its obligations to demilitarize and allow the extension of state administration to the territories it controls."	1
"The President emphatically described the unfortunate incident as unpleasant and unacceptable, as it foreshadows possible violence during the upcoming 2012 elections."	1
"As the presidential elections approach, there is an even greater need and urgency to improve the security situation."	0

Bosnia and Herzegovina is concerned about the current political impasse in establishing a new government and defining a clear constitutional reform process.	1

President Al-Bashir retaliated diplomatically against Kenya and threatened it with economic and trade sanctions.	1
"During these discussions, the Chinese delegation has always stressed its view that the Darfur issue involves a political process, the deployment of peacekeepers, economic development, humanitarian assistance and justice. It is very complex and requires enormous political wisdom to find a comprehensive solution that ensures the achievement of peace and justice."	0
"While a leader can be overthrown in a few months, the establishment of a democratic society requires more time and greater sacrifices."	0
"Otherwise, we may witness more violent ruptures when the people demand rights that no amount of coercion will convince them to abandon."	0
"In this context, we consider it important to draw the attention of the Security Council to the serious threats posed by radical and extremist religious organizations such as Hizb ut-Tahir, and urge the Council to impose the strongest possible sanctions against terrorist organizations."	1
"I must report, with great concern, an escalation in criminal acts and attacks against UN and humanitarian personnel."	1

"It is up to the people and leaders of the region to resist demagogic appeals, to forge and build coalitions, to remain confident in their system, even if they lose elections, and to defend the principles and institutions that will ultimately protect them."	0
We believe that Palestine will remain the greatest challenge in the Middle East.	0
These priorities are directly related to the credibility of the Executive Directorate.	0
"Consequently, the international community must take whatever measures are necessary to prevent Israel from persisting in the deplorable destructive policy it has undertaken in Gaza, and must stress its rejection of all such Israeli practices, which violate international law and international humanitarian law."	1
"Although unpredictable, these changes are proof of an old rule of politics: the inability to introduce reforms provokes revolutions."	0
This issue has never ceased to concern us.	1
"While a solution to the 60-year-old Palestinian tragedy would have a profound impact on the situation in the Middle East, peace in the region also requires progress on other axes of the peace process."	0
"That is also why I have deliberately omitted to touch on other topics that some would consider mandatory when discussing the Middle East, such as the imperative of overcoming the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the situation in Syria, since we have already addressed these issues at other Council meetings."	0
The meeting was called to order at 10:05 a.m.	0
But we are also against extrajudicial killings and condemn them.	1
We condemn all ethnically motivated acts and crimes perpetrated in Kosovo.	1

"The first observation concerns the situation on the ground, which is clearly worrisome."	0
"To meet these standards, more powers and responsibilities must be transferred to local authorities and privatization must be accelerated."	0
"After initial hesitation, the party chose to resolve this challenge in accordance with the law and in accordance with its own party constitution by holding new elections for party delegates."	0
"We felt that this process should be conducted in a way that allows all Afghans equally to participate in the elections, while taking into account the security challenges we face."	0
Aspects related to the definition of the roles and responsibilities of the PNTL and the Falintil-Forças de Defesa de Timor-Leste have also been raised.	0
