2008/s/pv_5855/333:7	Mr. President, We are disappointed that, despite your efforts and the efforts of many others, the Council was unable to condemn this heinous terrorist attack.	1

2010/s/pv_6276/171:2	In that context, we continue to be concerned about the most vulnerable citizens of Timor-Leste: the poor and the displaced.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/84:4	It is part of a mantra constantly repeated before this Council, which by no means turns out to be true, which ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights, and which fails to recognize the enormous difficulties that Israeli forces face in trying to protect their citizens and minimizing the damage to Palestinian lives when the terrorists they face show as little concern for Palestinian lives as they do for Israelis.	1
2007/s/pv_5788/68:3	We note the security concerns that Israel claims compel it to continue these flights, in particular alleged violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to resolution 1701 (2006).	1

2006/s/pv_5603/152:4	We could continue mentioning the widespread poverty, the problems of natural resource management, the thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, to which we must add thousands of ex-combatants waiting to be reintegrated, the weak and unreformed security sectors, massive human rights violations and many other threats that could instigate a new conflict.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/89:2	In that sense, we believe that destructive measures, whose purpose is to obtain unilateral political benefits, should be categorically condemned.	1
2010/s/pv_6353/91:1	While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has blamed the other for provoking the incident.	1
2010/s/pv_6353/161:3	We also wish to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents could lead to a situation of instability in the region that makes a peaceful solution to the situation in Kosovo that is acceptable to the parties difficult.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/75:3	Israel must also refrain from unilateral measures in Jerusalem that disrupt the status quo or undermine confidence.	1

2011/s/pv_6495/59:1	In addition to humanitarian difficulties, the situation raises security problems.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/201:2	As we have always stressed, this position does not imply any type of value judgment on the substance of the issue; It is a determined invitation to give justice and the political process a chance.	0
2004/s/pv_4952/90:4	The task is doable, however, as long as we set principled but realistic goals and move toward them with deliberate steps, as long as we are not alone in taking those steps.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/202:1	In order to make the most of the time at our disposal and to allow as many delegations as possible to speak, I will not invite speakers one by one to take a seat at the table or to return to the seats reserved for them. one side of the Hall.	0

2004/s/pv_5025/282:1	The Afghan authorities and the international community must clearly state that such behavior is unacceptable.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/187:5	To date Pristina has rejected any initiative in this regard.	1
2012/s/pv_6735/108:3	In that sense, the measures taken to address serious problems in the prison system are encouraging, despite the serious problems that still remain.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/69:2	Although the President acted in accordance with his constitutional prerogatives, I expressed concern that the pardon granted on December 25, 2009 could exacerbate perceptions of impunity.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/72:1	The Arab Spring confirms the warning of history that when governments respond with an iron fist to the irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands and invincible hopes of their citizens, they are ultimately doomed to failure.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/52:2	The progress made - and there is no doubt that there has been progress - must be examined in the context of the challenges that Kosovo has faced.	0

2012/s/pv_6735/147:3	A comprehensive approach, entirely under Afghan ownership, is essential to meeting that challenge.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/125:1	The first observation refers to the situation on the ground, which is clearly worrying.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/317:1	To meet these standards, more powers and responsibilities must be transferred to local authorities and privatization must be accelerated.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/55:3	After initial hesitation, the party chose to resolve this challenge legally and in accordance with its own party constitution by holding new elections for its party delegates.	0

2005/s/pv_5188/276:1	When I had the honor of addressing this issue before the Council in February (see S/PV.5130), I noted that the protection of minority communities, the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, freedom of movement and decentralization These were areas that required particular attention due to their direct link to our common goal of achieving a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/157:3	The Conference also reminded us of the difficult challenges before us.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/86:3	We are extremely concerned about this course of action, as it runs the serious risk of undermining the integrity of United Nations operations.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/172:2	This is why we condemn terrorism.	1
2010/s/pv_6444/52:1	The Security Council remains seriously concerned about the security situation in the Central African Republic.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/279:3	This is unacceptable and must be strongly rejected, especially by the Security Council, using the mechanisms at its disposal.	1

2005/s/pv_5188/120:2	However, we must not be mistaken: this is a challenge for all of Kosovo, not just for a minority.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/103:3	Some accusations that have appeared in the press are based on mere speculation, and it is important that the investigation be carried out with the calm that this type of situation demands.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/184:1	Somalis should take responsibility for ensuring their own security and establishing their own justice system to deal with threats to their security.	0

2011/s/pv_6579/65:4	The state of the Blue Nile continues to be a cause of concern for us.	1
2008/s/pv_5855/341:4	Therefore, United Nations bodies engaged in the fight against terrorism should address these fissures more seriously and with greater dedication.	1
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/419:2	In fact, Azerbaijan itself violates these resolutions, which call on the interested parties to undertake negotiations within the framework of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as through various contacts between them.	1
2011/s/pv_6656/51:2	I expressed the deep concern of this Council and the Secretary-General at the recent rise in tensions between the north and the south, as well as the continued lack of progress on Abyei and other post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues.	1

2012/s/pv_6734/58:4	I am very concerned about the latest escalation that has occurred between Gaza and Israel.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/281:4	It is clear that these circumstances represent the greatest obstacle to the stability and progress of Afghanistan and, if allowed to continue, threaten to undo the progress achieved over the course of almost three years.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/127:1	Promoting security and stability remains a fundamental issue.	1
2011/s/pv_6495/55:2	However, the process has also highlighted how significant the challenges remain in Liberia&#39;s security sector, especially with regard to the logistics, communications and mobility capabilities of the police and immigration service.	1
2012/s/pv_6709/64:1	Pakistan is deeply concerned by the report&#39;s conclusion that the humanitarian and economic challenges facing the Sahel region have been exacerbated as a fallout from the Libyan crisis.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/151:2	In particular, we condemn any attempt to force UNMIK into some kind of joint government, as well as any interference with the powers reserved to the Special Representative.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/298:4	We know that civil society organizations have expressed serious concerns in this regard.	1
2007/s/pv_5693/61:2	It is evident that all institutions in charge of establishing public order face serious challenges.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/65:1	Political pressures on UNMIK have increased significantly, and attempts have been made to question the role conferred upon it by resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	1
2008/s/pv_5855/253:5	Today we have no doubt that the true intention was to prevent the details of his vandalism from being made public while acting under the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency.	1
2009/s/pv_6236/97:1	The Government also shares a number of concerns expressed in the report which refer, among other things, to human rights and the situation of children and women.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/176:3	We are seriously concerned about this decree, which could have very broad consequences.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/237:4	However, we believe that an abrupt withdrawal would be counterproductive and would create an unprecedented vacuum, especially considering the fact that the conditions conducive to the long-awaited large-scale investment and sustainable development do not exist.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/333:1	At the outset, I would like to express our deep concern regarding the security situation in the country.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/105:1	I must say that the topic you have set for our debate today, while exciting, is a great challenge.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/185:3	As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/634), this is a truly daunting challenge.	1
2003/s/pv_4770/162:1	However, my delegation deplores the fact that security conditions remain worrying.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/67:3	I urge Hamas to respond positively to these calls.	1
2011/s/pv_6609/114:2	He strongly reiterated his personal condemnation of the incident, saying that it sent a very undesirable and damaging message ahead of the 2012 elections, which could contradict and spoil national achievements in changing the image of the country and establishing and consolidating peace, which which was so hard-won with the help of our development partners and the international community.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/93:1	Unfortunately, the current Palestinian leaders have demonstrated that they are as incapable of being peacemakers as they are of offering their people reform and democratic government.	1
2012/s/pv_6735/163:1	First, security concerns remain paramount.	1
2009/s/pv_6230/101:6	It is clear that the situation in Darfur does not meet the conditions necessary for the application of these provisions.	1
2011/s/pv_6609/86:1	First, although Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West African Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere is impeding data sharing and early warning.	1
2007/s/pv_5693/125:6	France strongly condemns this attack and calls on all parties to exercise utmost restraint.	1
2011/s/pv_6495/53:5	The political debate is likely to intensify as several election-related appeals have already been filed in court.	1
2012/s/pv_6709/120:1	The report confirms a worrying picture regarding the situation in the Sahel region and related issues of security, economic and humanitarian conditions.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/335:1	Secondly, Mr. Cŏvić expressed concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority -- the Kosovo Serbs -- is at risk of being outvoted. I would say that I consider the most important aspect of the Democracy is really the possibility of participating, exercising the rights of a democracy and voting.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/308:1	We have expressed our serious concern about the suffering of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/44:3	In Egypt, we continue to call for a peaceful and immediate transfer of power to a civilian Government.	1
2005/s/pv_5188/144:3	The situation of minorities remains a cause for concern, especially regarding freedom of movement and access to justice.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/219:1	Once again, we condemn the killing of civilians, whether Palestinians or Israelis.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/134:1	There is another challenge that must be addressed as a priority: the creation of a local and regional administration in the regions liberated from Al-Shabaab.	1
2005/s/pv_5243/35:1	Letter dated 26 July 2005 addressed to the President of the Security Council from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo (S/2005/436)	0
2010/s/pv_6353/207:2	We urge all parties to exercise restraint and avoid actions or statements that could incite further violence.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/181:4	The United States calls on the Haitian authorities to fulfill their commitment to fill the six Supreme Court vacancies by October 3, 2011.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/120:1	We are concerned that the success of the presidential elections is at risk of fading due to the lack of progress in forming the Government.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/139:2	The challenges facing the country require Haitian leaders to forge a common bond.	1
2004/s/pv_5077/65:1	However, there remains a possibility of a complete collapse of public order, in addition to a collapse of the fragile economy and a disintegration of autonomous institutions.	1
2012/s/pv_6709/128:4	The negative effects of the situation in Libya will continue to increase, posing a sustained threat to peace and stability in the region. China expresses its deep concern in this regard.	1
2011/s/pv_6495/73:1	It remains very concerning to me that Liberians&#39; efforts to rebuild their court system will take a long time, so the system itself is likely to remain fragile and easy to penetrate in the short term.	1
2004/s/pv_5077/78:6	In 1993, that vision was blurry, to say the least. At that time it was impossible to define the final objectives that would come close to addressing the concerns of both peoples.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/255:1	We have taken note of the caution of the Secretary-General and the technical assessment mission regarding security sector reform, and especially with respect to the PNTL.	1
2011/s/pv_6688/74:2	These false accusations contradict reason and the basic norms of a professional attitude. I am sure that the Council will reject them.	1
2011/s/pv_6609/96:1	The interest in the application of the joint communiqué of April 2, 2009, to which reference is made in the report, is notable.	1
2010/s/pv_6297/62:2	This has caused great tensions with local communities, as well as threats against MONUC by some former CNDP military commanders now integrated into the FARDC.	1
2010/s/pv_6353/140:2	We consider it unacceptable for us to deviate from this principle since the fragile situation in the province could lead to widespread destabilization.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/61:2	Voices of Haitian political leaders and civil society actors continue to be raised calling for a national consensus to be reached to advance in key areas such as national budget issues, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and the constitutional reform.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/216:1	The Government of Jordan emphasizes the need for the Government of Israel to immediately and completely stop its acts of violence and destruction in the Gaza Strip, as well as throughout the occupied Palestinian territory; to end its policy of deliberate destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and homes; and to immediately cease its extrajudicial killings and the imposition of collective punishments and other practices against the Palestinian people.	1
2008/s/pv_5855/153:5	However, we remain concerned that too much emphasis is placed on visits to developing countries.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/320:2	As UNAMA we would be irresponsible if we did not call on the international community, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan and international forces to put an end to this situation, especially on the southern border.	1
2006/s/pv_5492/55:3	While Hezbollah&#39;s actions are deplorable and, as I have already said, Israel has the right of self-defense, the excessive use of force must be condemned.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/108:1	The new democratic Government of Pakistan has inherited enormous political, economic and security problems.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/234:4	The sustained evolution of the situation in this direction would jeopardize efforts to restore and reconstruct the country and, in the long term, threaten peace and stability in the entire region.	1
2004/s/pv_5025/171:5	We have fenced a 25 kilometer stretch of border and installed floodlights and video cameras at border crossings.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/45:2	As Council members are aware, migration from North to South has begun and, for the first time, will represent the crossing of an international border.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/67:4	Calling into question the fundamental cornerstones of Palestine&#39;s legitimacy and national aspirations cannot be in the interests of the Palestinian people.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/61:1	The situation in Syria is of deep and growing concern to the United Nations.	1
2004/s/pv_5024/173:2	We are particularly concerned about the lack of preparation of mid-level public officials and the major deficiencies that still persist in the judicial field.	1
2004/s/pv_5024/98:1	While outside the mandate of UNMISET, the recent decision by an Indonesian Court of Appeal overturning four convictions by the Indonesian Special Court for Human Rights directly affects the broader issue of assigning responsibility. .	1
2009/s/pv_6236/36:1	The session opens at 10:55 a.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/58:1	I am particularly concerned about the unstable present that could deteriorate further if the political situation does not change and if the socioeconomic situation continues without being properly addressed.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/285:3	The United States must desist from this deliberate disregard, a practice it has maintained for almost seven years and which has led to the deterioration of the situation in the region.	1
2011/s/pv_6495/48:5	However, they were not significant enough to undermine the process. Simple logistics will make it difficult to achieve voting twice on Election Day.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/198:3	Likewise, we are also concerned about the situation faced by those who today collaborate in the reconstruction of the country.	1
2009/s/pv_6230/112:2	We are very concerned by the stubborn refusal of leaders of groups such as the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement to participate in the talks.	1
2011/s/pv_6544/46:2	The Council condemns any unilateral action that aims to create situations on the ground that undermine the results of the negotiations.	1
2011/s/pv_6544/41:3	The Council emphasizes that all those responsible for violations of international law, including humanitarian law and human rights law, as well as those who ordered such acts, must be held accountable.	1
2004/s/pv_4934/114:4	Statements such as that Palestinians do not love their children or that Palestinians send their children to their deaths because they hate Israel are racially charged words that reflect a kind of attitude that should be rejected outright, which I am now trying to do. .	1
2004/s/pv_5025/176:4	Blaming others, scapegoating others for the failures in Afghanistan, and asking those who are already doing more than they should to do even more is unfair, unacceptable, and will ultimately be counterproductive.	1
2004/s/pv_4934/108:2	We cannot send the message that terrorists will be immune and be satisfied with routine convictions.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/91:4	Many achievements have been achieved but many challenges remain.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/124:5	The recent publication by the Council of Ulema of a religious decree condemning drug trafficking and other related activities may be instrumental in discouraging poppy cultivation.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/286:3	We therefore encourage the members of the Council and also of the Group of Friends to consider favorably these recommendations of the Secretary General.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/113:4	Apparently, the population not only aspires but demands that more plural and representative governments generate tangible benefits for citizens.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/122:1	Timor-Leste continues to face significant challenges related to poverty reduction and the creation of employment opportunities, particularly for young people.	1
2009/s/pv_6230/152:3	In light of recent experiences, it is also evident that the Court will continue to face some serious problems.	0
2009/s/pv_6236/59:1	Another election-related challenge is the significant number of potential voters who cannot afford the administrative costs of obtaining a national identity card.	0
2011/s/pv_6544/47:2	The Council demands that the Government of the Sudan immediately withdraw from the Abyei area.	1
2010/s/pv_6276/126:1	Security sector reform remains one of the main challenges for long-term peace and stability.	1
2009/s/pv_6230/174:1	Uganda believes that ending impunity is the only deterrent against the crimes of greatest concern to the international community.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/153:3	We are deeply concerned that unless both sides demonstrate a strong will to end terrorism and violence, the peace process will not succeed.	1
2008/s/pv_6024/135:1	We note that, in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	1
2012/s/pv_6734/269:1	Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continued illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.	1
2011/s/pv_6618/201:3	We were therefore frustrated that the Secretary-General&#39;s report recommended only a partial reduction in reinforcement troops.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/215:3	However, what Afghanistan has now achieved is significantly undermined by serious challenges to its security and stability.	1
2012/s/pv_6729/111:1	While air piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a serious problem, we ask the international community not to forget that the solution must be found on land, not at sea. The comprehensive resolution of the Somali conflict must address all the root causes of piracy and other problems, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic waste.	1
2008/s/pv_6049/148:1	The second aspect I want to address today is our constant concern for the well-being of the innocent people in Gaza and in the towns and cities of southern Israel.	1
2008/s/pv_5930/364:5	Finally, there is an urgent need for Afghans to take the lead in the fight against narcotics.	1
2006/s/pv_5492/53:3	I also condemn Hezbollah&#39;s reckless disregard for the wishes of the elected Government of Lebanon and for the interests of the Lebanese people and the region at large.	1
2007/s/pv_5798/43:1	&quot;The Security Council strongly condemns the terrorist attacks that occurred in Algiers on 11 December 2007 in the vicinity of the Supreme Court and the United Nations offices, which caused numerous deaths and injuries, and expresses its deep regret and condolences to the victims of this atrocious act of terrorism and their families, as well as the people and Government of Algeria.	1
2004/s/pv_5049/36:1	The session opens at 4:05 p.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/71:1	I also remember how unpopular it was to talk to Israelis about the 1967 borders, and for a long time it was almost inconceivable to propose the evacuation of Israeli settlements.	1
