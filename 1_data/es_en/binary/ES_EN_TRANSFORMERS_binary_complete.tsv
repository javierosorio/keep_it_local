"“The Security Council insists that RCD-Goma shall be held responsible for any extrajudicial execution, including of members of civil society or persons detained in detention centres in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Kisangani."	1
"These challenges, together, exert political pressure on Governments and have direct and dangerous implications for peace, security and stability in the affected countries."	1
"In that regard, I would like to emphasize once again that, unlike other well-known situations involving unfounded and illegitimate territorial claims, including those under the invented pretext of dealing with minority ethnic groups, the right to self-determination and the status of State of the Palestinian people has been recognized."	1
"“At the 4364th meeting, held in private on 5 September 2001, the Security Council considered the situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo."	0

"The firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza continues, even as we speak; these rockets are deliberately targeting the civilian community, targeting innocent civilians, who are terrified while lying on their beds, sitting in the living rooms of their homes or taking their children to school."	1
"I would also like to reiterate that the four F-FDTL members who were convicted of murder in the shooting that resulted in the death of eight PNTL officers in 2006, one of whom was pardoned and the other three received reductions in their sentence, have not yet paid the widows of the victims the compensation ordered by the court."	1
"Such actions can be regarded as indirect participation in the deception of public opinion and contempt for the position of the Syrian Government with regard to events in its own territory, which is an irresponsible incitement to all kinds of violent acts, providing international cover for international terrorist acts committed by terrorist groups against Syria, its interests and its people."	1
"Let us speak frankly: these stories from the press, human rights groups and civilians on the ground raise great concern about the nature and magnitude of the conflict."	1
The leaders of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government often evade their responsibilities under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	1
"Among those concerns, one must highlight: the deterioration of the security situation in recent weeks and months."	1
"It is with greater concern that I must report today that, despite the considerable efforts made by UNAMID, the security situation in Darfur has not improved much."	1
The socio-economic challenges facing Afghanistan are important.	1
"Its themes include financing the electoral campaign, electoral activities and public order, access to the mass media and misuse of government resources for political purposes."	1

"There is concern about the deterioration in the standard of living of the population as a consequence of the difficulties that had to be faced in 2008, in particular the global food crisis and the scourge of hurricanes that ravaged the island."	1
"However, they also expressed concern that every time there is a sign of hope in the Middle East there is an escalation of violence and destruction."	1
"In particular, I would like to stress that the Taliban -- as his report concludes -- continue to pose a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and containing them is an essential aspect."""	1
"However, the country continues to face difficulties in its struggle for stability and development, including the security situation, the worsening humanitarian situation, challenges in the areas of the rule of law and human rights and the continuing violence that has resulted in the death of civilians, which continues to increase."	1

"We categorically condemn this morning's ruthless attack on the shrines of Iman Ali al-Hadi and Imam Hassan al-Askari in Samarra, and share the indignation of the Iraqi people over that crime, which is another deliberate attempt by Al-Qaida to sow dissent and confront religious currents in Iraq."	1
"This means that secessionists continue to blatantly disregard international law, thus rejecting the universal principles of the Charter of the United Nations."	1
We emphasize the tragic consequences that those messages had recently had elsewhere on the continent.	1
"However, let no one be mistaken: my country is also ready to resist the unilateral declaration of independence unceasingly until a compromise solution is seen."	1
"As at 23 June, over 1.1 million people had crossed Libya's borders into Tunisia, Egypt, the Niger, Algeria, Chad and the Sudan."	0
The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.	0
Administrative reform at the national level so far does not represent an improvement.	1
We emphasize the issue of violence to express our impatience regarding the urgency of finding satisfactory solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	1
I am concerned that this vote and this stalemate in Parliament could undermine the important achievements that Somali stakeholders and their partners have made.	1
"In all those talks, I was encouraged to find a convergence of views: we were all amazed at the many progress that Liberia has made since the fighting ended in 2003, but we are all fully aware of the daunting challenges that Liberia still faces and that, ultimately, we cannot take anything for granted."	1
"Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian Special Court process, further remedial action would be required to ensure justice."	1

"The number of attacks against national and international security forces, officials of public institutions and humanitarian personnel has increased, and attacks on polling stations and threats against registration teams have increased."	1
"This became clear in the recent incidents of DIS indiscipline, namely the alleged killing of a civilian by a DIS commander in Farchana on 22 March."	1
We note that the enduring challenges faced by the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	1
"At the same time, my delegation believes that the elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, in particular the Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their electorate if they adopted a more participatory attitude, rather than withdrawing from the legislature when faced with a difficult situation."	1
We should not underestimate the threat posed in Afghanistan by the destabilizing activities of the Taliban and Al-Qaida.	1
"Although neither side seems willing to return to war, there is a worrying pattern of escalation of tension and destabilization that could lead to large-scale confrontation and endanger the lives of civilians."	1
"Nevertheless, the situation within Kosovo is still worrying."	1
"Like other speakers who preceded us and in line with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the act that led to the death of Mr. Dzeković and the wounding of others during the protests that took place on 2 July in northern Mitrovica."	1

We urge Israel to cease its military incursions into Gaza.	1

Recent developments in the region confirm the concerns systematically conveyed to the mission by its interlocutors.	1
We have also noted that the spiral of violence has forced entire populations to move to escape violence.	0
Those acts were absolutely unacceptable; the Palestinian Authority must put an end to such attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice.	1
"During our previous debate, Belgium had shared the concern expressed by the Secretary-General about the dangers posed by violence in Iraq to a society, institutions and political process that remain fragile."	1
We urge the Palestinian Authority to make every effort to put an end to these attacks.	1
"In conclusion, while Timor-Leste has made significant progress, it still faces many serious challenges in its efforts to establish a stable democracy and develop its economy."	0
The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees of its security as a State.	1
This is obviously because the States concerned rejected their measures.	1
"It is important to give women, who are the first victims of violence in all its manifestations, a leading role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and it is even more important and urgent to do so in the conflict prevention process."	1
"However, challenges remain on the road to lasting peace and stabilization in Darfur."	0
These actions have been undertaken in spite of the clear position taken against them by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and in defiance of the provisions of the United Nations and the Security Council.	1
The alarming situation with regard to drug trafficking calls for other measures.	0
The challenge is to ensure that our outrage is translated into determined and determined action that bears rapid and measurable fruit.	0
They insist on treating the case as a simple immigration offence.	1
"I repeat again today what I said on 31 January (see S/PV.6710), it is unacceptable that the Council should be prevented from assuming its responsibilities."	1
His mission represents the last opportunity to prevent a crisis from unfolding in Syria.	0
"This occurred despite repeated condemnations of these inhumane acts in Council resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), which became beacons of hope for millions of women and girls who were abused worldwide."	1
"The second is to call once again, as a matter of urgency, for the Security Council to take essential steps to stop the bloodshed in Syria."	1
"Faced with this clear situation of threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without the double standards that characterize it on this subject and adopt, urgently and decisively, the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the countries that make up the Arab Group."	1
"The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance with the usual practice, I would like to remind all speakers to limit their statements to a maximum of five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work diligently."	0

The meeting was called to order at 4.10 p.m.	0
"The report before us is a difficult reading, but it also sets a challenge."	0
"In conclusion, in the context of world peace and the Middle East, I would like to stress that, while we understand all the different needs emanating from security, it would be better for that region and the entire world to avoid the situation in Iran becoming a conflict, because it would be the kind of conflict that would have a very regrettable impact on the world and could be the straw that filled the glass -- as the proverb says -- of world peace."	0
"We are deeply concerned that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated against each other, despite the fact that the international community and the Security Council have clearly expressed their abhorrence of that situation."	1
"In order to complete the transfer process, a number of logistical requirements must be met."	0
"Given its current political status, Kosovo remains far from foreign direct investment and does not qualify for the programmes and assistance of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which would have a direct impact on the development of a stable and efficient economy."	0
This is an important step in the right direction.	0
"Furthermore, tensions at the border could lead to serious violence during the migration period, particularly in the Abyei Area, from which neither side has fully withdrawn."	0
"This would entail stronger measures with regard to the eviction of those who, with the threat of violence, are using Serbian property illegally."	0
"The first is that the demands for human rights and freedom are universal and will extend for themselves over time, as they are fundamental human aspirations."	0
"We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to comply with the obligation contained in resolution 2036 (2012) to ban trade in Somali charcoal, particularly by the most active elements in that trade."	1
"Israel has legitimate security concerns, but these can only be addressed fully effectively through a negotiated agreement."	0
"At the same time, we are concerned by the observation in the report that the work on the demarcation of the land border between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is not proceeding expeditiously."	0
"This is important in strengthening the Mission's capacity to provide genuine protection to the Congolese civilian population, which is the victim of an obvious humanitarian disaster, as stressed by Mr. Doss, and of massive human rights violations, including acts of violence directed against women and children."	1
"Given its role as a leading country in these efforts, the United Kingdom knows, perhaps better than others sitting around this table, how immense the long-term challenge of the fight against drugs is."	0
That is why I have focused more on the part of the opportunities than on the challenges in my speech.	0
Measures that could weaken confidence or damage the outcome of negotiations should be suspended and reversed.	1
"The siege must be lifted immediately so that the civilian population in Gaza can have access, essentially, to water, jobs, trade, medical care and education, in short, access to their basic needs."	1
I would like to remind speakers that they should limit their statements to a maximum of four minutes so that the Council can carry out its work expeditiously.	0
My delegation is concerned that the security situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate.	1
We must reject any attempt to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	1
Terrorists have therefore failed to achieve their strategic goal of preventing many volunteers from coming to rebuild the country.	0
We were even hampered in condemning the violence and in adopting a peaceful plan drawn up by Syria's own neighbours.	1
"The fact that both sides, the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan, use rhetoric intensively, is a matter of concern."	1
Egypt once again demands that Israel immediately cease its attacks on Gaza.	1
"The statement outlines issues of concern, and towards its end the urgent appeal of Somali women to the international community to raise gender issues, including Somali leaders, is welcomed."	1
"Despite overall progress, it should be noted that poverty and unemployment remain a formidable challenge, as highlighted by Ms. Ameerah Haq."	0
We are gravely concerned that the special processes created for that purpose appear to have failed.	1
"However, the challenges involved will be much greater, as they will constitute one-day events, and logistics will be hampered by Liberia's heavy rainy season."	0
"However, Chad's experience left a strong imprint on our peacekeeping forces and increased awareness of the challenge facing the United Nations in that regard."	0
"Combating that scourge requires strengthening our criminal prosecution capacity, our judicial system, our civilian police and even our prison system."	0
"We have noted with concern that the Secretary-General believes that many of the factors fuelling the 2006 crisis remain present in society, making it vulnerable to instability."	1
"We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d'Ivoire, as the Council may have noticed in my statement this morning."	1
It also stresses that Rwanda has an obligation to use its great influence to ensure that RCD-Goma does not carry out any of these actions.	1
National security forces are not yet in a position to respond to these threats in remote areas because of their limited capacity.	0
"The important challenges and challenges related to security and national reconciliation, which, in my view, require the political attention of the Council, should not be underestimated."	0
"Pursuant to those resolutions, this body must demand that the Government of the United States immediately try Luis Posada Carriles for his terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose justice he has been demanding for years."	1
"The Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations should make greater efforts in prevention activities, such as the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation."	1

We must now expedite work on our mutual obligations.	0
"Indeed, the European Union believes that strong socio-economic development is necessary to sustain and consolidate the new stability."	0
"No State in our region, whatever its domestic resources, can alone face the challenges of terrorism, secession and development, nor can it guarantee democracy and the spirit of openness."	0
The mission's requirements for resolution 1325 (2000) were more specific and detailed during the deployment of the European Union military operation than during the subsequent deployment of MINURCAT.	0
"As grave and condemnable as that act was, it was an isolated act."	0
"Conflicts in the region have complex root causes involving multiple factors, such as political differences, unequal distribution of economic resources and tribal confrontations, and the possibility of a resumption and expansion of the conflict persists; the achievement of peace will continue to require the tireless efforts of all parties."	0
All parties concerned must ensure that Kosovo is a place where ethnic tolerance and multiculturalism allow for peaceful coexistence among communities.	0
"I believe that by combining his performance with that of Ambassador Jurica as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Council, our work on counter-terrorism has been reactivated."	0
"In our view, the holding of legislative elections without delay and in a relatively peaceful climate is an important achievement, which marked a major step towards the restoration of constitutional order, a more inclusive government and the completion of a fundamental unfinished aspect of the peace process."	0
Peoples around the world demand their universal human rights.	0
"In that regard, the recommendations made by the assessment team to prevent the spread of conflicts, destabilize States and worsen humanitarian problems required the utmost attention."	0
We urge Israel to respect its obligations towards the population of the occupied territories.	1
"In post-conflict situations, too, the challenges faced by women remain daunting."	0
"However, non-intervention to restore stability in that country already calls into question the effectiveness of the international community and involves enormous amounts of costly resources."	1
"We remain concerned that, despite all attempts to restore peace and security, efforts to stabilize the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have recently been affected by major setbacks."	1
Chile further understands that operative paragraph 2 of the failed draft resolution includes a condemnation of suicide attacks that have often affected innocent civilians in Israel.	1

"The Council notes with concern the problems in the area of socio-economic development, as the living standards of the vast majority of Haitians have fallen sharply."	1
We see encouraging signs in this regard and significant achievements in this very important endeavour.	0
This is an international obligation that States must fulfil in order to contribute to justice for the victims of such painful events.	1
Members of the Council should know that all necessary measures have been taken and will continue to be taken to arrest the perpetrators as quickly as possible.	0
"Not only is the timetable for the next elections beginning to move closer, but there is also a need to monitor closely the situation on the Liberian border with Côte d'Ivoire because of the possible security implications it may have."	0
"In that context, despite the fact that the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular take the fight against terrorism more seriously, there is little evidence that a truly joint effort is being made to provide a more united international response to terrorism."	1
We know that conflict situations are often characterized by breaches of public order.	0
"Our main concern in that regard is the fact that, according to the report, none of the eight standards has yet been fully complied with."	1
Afghanistan will face decisive challenges in the coming months.	0

"First, let me stress the importance of building on the current negotiations, both the Israeli-Palestinian track and the Israeli-Syrian track."	0
"It is, however, inadmissible to attempt to justify on the basis of valid security concerns, measures that indiscriminately affect an entire people, in contravention of international humanitarian law."	1

We note with concern that the area of security remains problematic.	1
"The first issue is the drug situation in Afghanistan, a serious and growing challenge not only for Afghanistan but also for the rest of the world."	0

Violence and displacement are an immediate challenge to the credibility of the voting process.	0
The fight against impunity is also of paramount importance in the prevention of sexual violence.	0
These activities undermine the weak foundations of the Afghan State and impede the achievement of lasting stability.	0
"At this stage in the peacebuilding process, such behaviour could be misinterpreted and incite violence, which could lead to a relapse into conflict."	0
The challenge now is to build on that platform and realize the promise of peace.	0

Perhaps the main long-term challenges for Timor-Leste will be socio-economic in nature.	0
"At the same time, Cuba expresses its condemnation of suicide bombings and other acts directed against Israeli civilians, innocent victims of the spiral of violence caused by the policy of its Government, while opposing the manipulation of such isolated acts to question the exercise of self-defence by the Palestinian people and to justify actions, both selective and large-scale, against the Palestinian population."	1
"First, it is important to take into account two equally legitimate wishes: on the one hand, the requirement of minorities to live in security, to have equal opportunities for economic development and equal access to social services and education, and to exercise the right of return; on the other hand, the will of the majority of the population to exercise its right to self-determination."	0

"In the view of the delegation of Togo, all those problems required prompt action to prevent the Sahel region from being plunged into widespread insecurity, which would be very detrimental to its development."	1
"The other crucial elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by increasing the efficiency, impartiality and overall functioning of the judicial system, and improving law enforcement institutions to curb organized crime and ethnic violence and bring all offenders to justice."	1
"This requires a clear stance, especially, speaking honestly, on the part of the United States of America."	1
We are dealing with these problems in a democratic and effective manner.	0
"It is obvious that the continued assistance of the international community will be needed and that, as the Secretary-General points out in his report,"	0
"At the same time, President Al-Bashir is threatening the international community with reprisals and even more crimes."	1
"In the current extremely difficult situation, we urge both Israelis and Palestinians to prevent the escalation of the conflict and to begin to fulfil their obligations under the road map to revive the prospects for peace."	1
Now we know better the depth of challenges that we only imagined then.	0
"If these matters are resolved in favour of the Prosecutor's Office, the accused persons will be found guilty of the charges against them."	0
"He added that it can undermine the peace, security and stability of the State."	0
"Despite these challenges, we cannot fail to recognize that approximately 50 per cent of the Afghan population lives in areas where responsibility for security has been transferred to the Afghan security forces."	1
The humanitarian consequences of the persistence of violence in Iraq are of great concern to my delegation.	1
"Minorities, especially the Serb minority, have a fundamental obligation to participate fully in the search for solutions, taking advantage of all opportunities offered to participate in Kosovo institutions."	0
It was high time for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most basic rights of the Palestinian people and to help put an end to the vicious cycle of violence caused by Israel's continuing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories.	1
Brazil is also convinced that a comprehensive strategy combining security and development is necessary to achieve a stable Somalia.	0
"All this requires a determined struggle against entrenched non-State actors, whose existence represents a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of the sovereignty of the Afghan State."	1
"We are disappointed, Mr. President, that, despite your efforts and the efforts of many others, the Council could not condemn that heinous terrorist attack."	1
"Despite these advances, however, some challenges remain to the authority of the Government and its effective control over the national territory."	1
"It is also indisputable that, as an occupying Power, Armenia has direct responsibility for the commission of such crimes."	1
"In order to achieve more concrete progress, the international community must act more in concert and with greater determination to establish the basic framework."	0
Another current challenge is the political stalemate in the Transitional Federal Parliament.	0
"In that context, we remain concerned about the most vulnerable citizens of Timor-Leste: the poor and displaced."	1
"It is part of a constantly repeated mantra before this Council, which is not overrepeated, which ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights and does not recognize the enormous difficulties faced by Israeli forces in trying to protect their citizens and minimize damage to Palestinian lives when the terrorists they face show as little concern for the lives of Palestinians as they do for Israelis."	1
"We note the security concerns that, according to Israel, compel it to continue those flights, particularly the alleged violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to resolution 1701 (2006)."	1
Today I will emphasize only the following four aspects.	0
Lack of land and employment and insecurity prevent many of the people returning to their communities of origin.	1
The Government of Germany strongly condemns these acts of violence.	1
"Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I apologize for calling for the floor once again. We believe that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to ignore in silence the remarks made by the representative of Armenia and his attempt to confuse the Council."	1
The continuing difficulties and suffering of the Palestinian people continue to be a tragic representation of the consequences of non-implementation of the resolutions and non-compliance with the decisions of the Security Council.	1
The meeting was called to order at 6.10 p.m.	0
This month Prime Minister Fayyad distributed a summary of the Palestinian reform and development plan for 2008-2010.	0
"This unpleasant political incident was strongly condemned in a press release issued immediately after the incident by the Office of President Ernest Bai Koroma and in numerous press releases subsequently issued by other political interest groups, including APC and PMDC parties, the Independent Media Commission, the Political Parties Registration Commission and the Campaign for Good Governance."	1
"We could continue to mention widespread poverty, natural resource management problems, the thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, to which thousands of ex-combatants must be added while awaiting reintegration, weak and unreformed security sectors, massive human rights violations and many other threats that could instigate a new conflict."	1
"In that regard, we believe that destructive measures, aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits, should be categorically condemned."	1
"While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has blamed the other for provoking the incident."	1
"We also wish to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents may lead to a situation of instability in the region that hinders a peaceful solution to the situation in Kosovo, acceptable to the parties."	1
Israel must also refrain from unilateral measures in Jerusalem that would alter the status quo or undermine confidence.	1
"Organized crime, deeply rooted in political and social life, together with extremism, endangers the very foundations of the principles and values that we are trying to infuse into the new institutions that have been established there and to make our efforts useless."	1
"As a result, the limits of security threats in many countries within and outside Africa, including members of this Council, have been exceeded, exposing their vulnerabilities."	1
"In addition to humanitarian challenges, the situation poses security challenges."	0
"As we have always stressed, this position does not imply any kind of value judgement on the substance of the issue; it is a determined invitation to give justice and the political process a chance."	0
"However, the task is feasible, as long as we set ourselves principles-based but realistic goals and move towards them with deliberate action, provided that we are not alone in taking such action."	0
"In order to make the most of the time available to me and to allow as many delegations as possible to take the floor, I will not invite speakers one by one to take a seat at the table or to resume the seat reserved for them at the side of the Chamber."	0
"Failure to comply with its obligations under the Charter should have consequences for any Member State, and the Sudan should not be the exception."	1
"As I have emphasized on many occasions, the lasting security and stability of any country, including Timor-Leste, can be achieved only through corresponding socio-economic development."	0
"We believe that Somalia has a challenge compared to that of a marathonist, since the drafting of the constitution must end on 20 April, which must then be adopted on 22 May."	1
The impunity of these high-ranking officials is unacceptable and prevents communities emerging from conflict from recovering sustainably.	1
The Afghan authorities and the international community must clearly state that such behaviour is unacceptable.	1
Pristina has so far rejected any such initiative.	1
"In that regard, the measures taken to address the serious problems in the prison system were encouraging, despite the serious problems that remained."	0
"While the President acted in accordance with his constitutional prerogatives, I expressed concern that the pardon granted on 25 December 2009 could exacerbate perceptions of impunity."	1
"The Arab Spring confirms history's warning that when Governments respond iron fistedly to irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands and invincible hopes of their citizens, they are ultimately doomed to failure."	0
The progress made -- and there is no doubt that progress has been made -- should be considered in the context of the challenges that Kosovo has faced.	0
"First, they have created a permanent humanitarian emergency that, at the same time, threatens peace and stability in Haiti."	1
Building effective Somali judicial capacity will also enable Somalis to combat the scourge of terrorism and piracy.	0
"It is clear that our collective efforts require considerable resources and greater integration, which is reflected in the outcomes of the conferences held in Bucharest and Paris."	0
"That is why Greece has insisted on the need to clarify, in the sixth preambular paragraph, in which the Council calls for “progress towards the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement”, which should be reiterated that such negotiations must take place between the two communities."	1
"In that regard, we want to go further and say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to enable the Somali security forces to control the most violent insurgents and to enable the Government to expand its areas of authority as far as possible if peace negotiations fail."	1
"In his report, the Secretary-General notes that some progress has been made in most of these areas, except for the essential issue of local governance reform and, in particular, decentralization, where progress, by comparison, is not sufficient."	1
The Court's intervention is called upon to be the catalyst for decisive national and international action to respond to the challenges of justice in conflict situations.	0
"Some concerns have been expressed about the fairness of registration, the most recent of which have been raised by several presidential candidates."	1
"To continue in this struggle, the international community needs to make a greater contribution and pay more attention to this important aspect of the fight against terrorism."	1
The long-term security and stability of Somalia will require a reliable and effective justice system.	0
The meeting was called to order at 1 p.m.	0
"It is a difficult transition, requiring patience and persistence."	0
My delegation strongly condemns these acts of violence and expresses its condolences to the family of the deceased pediatrician.	1
"In return, the Belgrade authorities should put an end to the obstruction tactic that prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo's public institutions. “The empty chair policy” carries a great risk, the risk that Kosovo's history will be written without Kosovo Serbs."	1
The Haitian National Police will have to have adequate resources to carry out its constitutional law enforcement functions.	0
"At the same time, I can understand the need of the international community to direct its attention and resources to other hotbeds of tension around the world."	0
We are particularly concerned about the uncontrolled proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond as a result of the conflict.	1
That would truly demonstrate that United Nations counter-terrorism efforts are global in nature and that Member States are united.	0
That is a complex challenge for Sahelian countries and regional agencies.	0
"We call upon Israel to take further steps to eliminate settler outposts, in accordance with the road map and to address the increasing threat of settler extremism."	1
"In fact, it is vital that there be a greater presence of the United Nations, but if the added value of our Organization is to be fully exploited, the necessary means, both in terms of troops and security, as Mr. Eide recalled a few minutes ago, will have to be available."	1
"With regard to the military aspects of security sector reform, the Government has made it clear that it wishes to rely heavily on bilateral aid to enhance the capabilities of the army."	1
"In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the lack of progress in the area of freedom of movement of minorities, sustainable returns and significant representation of minorities in government structures and in the public sector at large."	1
"My Government appreciates the many expressions of condemnation and indignation that this atrocity has provoked, and we are particularly grateful for the Security Council's rapid reaction to this truculent crime."	1
"Indeed, because there is a history of foreign interference in the region, such recommendations will not only be suspicious in the eyes of various segments of society, but may also have the capacity to aggravate the problem."	1
"Above all, what we were most concerned about was the insistence of the Pristina authorities to implement in some way the so-called strategy for the northern part of Kosovo, in flagrant contravention of resolution 1244 (1999), which is the main international legal platform for resolving the Kosovo issue."	1
"Members of the Council have before them document S/2005/745, which contains the text of a letter dated 7 December 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia addressed to the President of the Security Council transmitting the report of the Panel of Experts on Liberia."	0
"In particular, we would like to express our deep concern at the stagnation of levels of socio-economic development in Haiti and its food security."	1
"It should be emphasized, however, that without a strong justice and security sector, the flourishing peace and stability in the country could be threatened."	1
"The international community has clearly expressed its strong condemnation of such acts through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Group of Friends of Syria, which enjoys broad and extensive participation."	1
"The five or six incidents in the border areas, at least those reported, have occurred in Nangarhar and Zabul, near the border with Pakistan."	0
"This is an extremely urgent issue, as Kenya can no longer bear the burden of this situation."	0
It is clear that the Executive Directorate must continue its efforts to achieve these goals.	0
"The threat to security and stability in Afghanistan posed by terrorists, criminals and those involved in illicit drug trafficking is real and must be addressed constantly."	1
We hope that by the end of this year there will be instruments for more effective law enforcement in the area of counter-narcotics.	0
"We condemn all acts of terrorism in Afghanistan, especially the most recent in the Indian Embassy in Kabul, and express our condolences to the Governments and peoples of the countries concerned, as well as to the families of the victims."	1
"The collection of timely, accurate, reliable and objective information on conflict-related sexual violence is essential for adapting the Council's responses, as well as for enhancing action to prevent sexual violence."	1
"The true establishment of the rule of law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo requires the formation of an effective and democratic army, judicial system and police force."	1
"The international community should -- including through the auspices of the United Nations -- use diplomatic influence and facilitate, inter alia, technical assistance in areas such as political, security and justice sector reform; the drafting of new constitutions and legal frameworks; and the promotion of electoral institutions and elections."	1
The ongoing instability in the Sahel has implications that go beyond the countries most directly affected.	0
It calls for adherence to international law and compliance by the parties with their obligations and the road map to achieve the vision of two States living side by side in peace and security.	1
We cannot run the risk of losing the financial and human effort made so far in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to citizen frustration and eventually resurrecting the crisis and conflict.	0
The Council would be in breach of its obligation if it did not use those tools when circumstances so required.	0
"In these conditions, where profound inequalities and political, economic and social exclusion converge, a process of transformation of the prevailing order breaks out in search of economic and political changes and alternatives of participation and openness to new spaces and mechanisms of expression that imply, in sum, the vindication of fundamental rights."	1
ISAF troops must fully fulfil their mandate to eradicate the threats emanating from Afghanistan.	1
"In the view of my delegation, to prevent further outbreaks of violence and instability in the northern region of Kosovo, it remains essential that the reconciliation process be accompanied by policies aimed at ensuring the socio-economic stability of communities in a non-discriminatory manner."	1
"Retaining that level of funding would render any Government useless, and, more rightly, an authority in occupied territory. If funds were not immediately unblocked, the achievements of State consolidation, including improved governance that would benefit the Palestinian people and the development of law and order security forces in the West Bank, would be jeopardized."	1
"As members of the Council know better than anyone else, the Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the greatest diplomatic challenges the world has faced since the mid-20th century. At the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a controversy with historical narratives, collective aspirations and opposing and contradictory identities."	0
Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a common concern of all members of the United Nations and of the international community at large.	1
"Of course, this causes growing concern among the population and calls into question the excessive dependence on the military option."	0
"However, there is a serious danger that, as a result of that decision, which violates the documents of the Bonn and Berlin conferences, the country will face an explosive situation characterized by a new armed resistance and the internal division of power structures."	1
Finding a starting point for discussions on the remaining challenges facing societies in the Middle East and identifying the potential opportunities arising from those problems could be a onerous task.	0
"Addressing the causes of economic failure requires ongoing projects based on sound principles of trade and economics, especially given the strategic situation of the region within the African continent and the fact that it has a large amount of natural resources."	0
"They have taken all these actions, and then they ask for protection and guarantees and make these arguments to continue extorting us and obtaining further concessions from us."	1
"Since the publication of the report, attention to the situation on the Liberian border with Côte d'Ivoire has increased considerably."	0
"In assessing that progress, it is important to recognize how much progress Timor-Leste has made in the few years since independence, but equally important is to recognize the important challenges that still need to be faced."	0
I would also like to point out the active Arab diplomacy leading up to the conference.	0
"The prohibition of illegal cross-border movement is vital in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling."	1
"Of course, there are those who feel uncomfortable about what they regard as excessive and, indeed, negative concern about ethnic balance."	0
"Although almost 80 per cent of the Afghan population is directly dependent on agriculture for their subsistence, only a very small amount of money has been allocated to that sector of the economy."	0
"Unless addressed by the Government, those problems could pose serious threats to the security and stability of Timor-Leste."	1
"However, prevention would be effective only if peacekeeping operations had the resources to carry out their mandate."	0
The ability of the Palestinian Authority to build reliable institutions and a security infrastructure capable and ready to combat terrorism and other threats is a key element in the creation of a Palestinian State and a legitimate expectation on the part of Israel.	0
"It is clear that definitive progress in these areas will require further concerted efforts on the part of the international community, as well as Belgrade and the Kosovars."	0
Viet Nam is of the view that the diverse nature of violence against women and girls requires a comprehensive approach.	0
"The current problems of the Afghan communities require a comprehensive solution, which is not limited strictly to military and security activities, but also covers political, economic and development activities."	0
"In our view, it is important that the Conference has clearly emphasized the importance of Afghan leadership and, ultimately, ownership of efforts to meet the key challenges facing Afghanistan: security, lack of institutional capacity, corruption and narcotics."	0
"In order to avoid a new wave of violence, both sides and the international community must act promptly."	1
"In order to restore real stability, a comprehensive and far-reaching approach, including a comprehensive set of legal, political and international tools, is needed."	0
"We strongly condemn these practices, which constitute a flagrant violation of international norms and humanitarian law, and we therefore urge the international community, the Quartet and all others concerned to intervene immediately and decisively to demand that Israel put an end to such acts, which pose a serious threat to peace and security in the Middle East region; violence only generates violence; the region will be trapped in a vicious circle from which it will find it difficult to escape."	1
This is particularly true of the political sphere and the security situation.	0
"In this regard, we are very concerned about the prevailing security situation in Afghanistan, which has deteriorated since last year as a result of the remaining Taliban subversive activities and Al-Qaida elements, clashes between warlords and drug trafficking."	1
Somali leaders must work towards a political process that is open to all those willing to reject violent opposition.	1
International terrorism remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.	0
"When UNMIK and KFOR requested data on the presence of the Army in the Kosovo Protection Corps, they received a very typical response from the KPC commander, who said that, given his limited competencies, he could not provide further information."	1
Allow me briefly to refer to the specific proposals contained in the revised organizational plan and how these concerns are addressed.	0
It is important that the police have visibility and acceptance in the community as the main law enforcement agency.	0
"While this is constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the parties would be expected to submit territorial and security proposals within 90 days, are still not taking place."	1
"While this is a good starting point, its long-term sustainability will only be achieved if the Government makes complementary efforts to address other socio-economic problems."	0
We need peace in order to be able to deal with other equally daunting challenges.	0
"Economic issues, and investment in particular, are also of serious concern."	0
"In that context, Russia is convinced of the importance of developing a comprehensive international counter-narcotics strategy, including the establishment of a security belt at the Afghan borders."	0
Sierra Leone is also experiencing increased investment in the mining sector.	0
"Some of these countries face enormous challenges, and there will be setbacks and progress in the coming years."	0
We urge the Government of Haiti to take strong measures to prevent such violence and to ensure that those responsible for such acts are brought to justice.	1
"Subsequently, seven years later, in the 2009 edition, it was further noted that approximately 30 per cent of young people in Arab countries were unemployed, that more than 50 per cent of the population was under 24 years of age, and that 51 million new jobs needed to be created by 2020 to avoid rising unemployment."	0
These issues need to be addressed within the framework of security sector reform.	0
The Russian Federation once again calls upon the Israeli and Palestinian parties to exercise restraint and a high level of responsibility and to deny unilateralism.	1
I cannot fail to stress the risk posed by the lack of military helicopters to the operational effectiveness of the force.	1
Some of our Iraqi interlocutors asked what exactly national reconciliation meant and what it required.	0
"As outlined in the report, significant progress was made during the period under review in the peace process as well as in the preparations for the 2010 elections, despite some remaining challenges."	0
"Beyond the MINURCAT area of responsibility in eastern Chad, other developments are also of concern."	1
"Also, representative democracy requires that citizens have confidence in the governments they choose."	0
"Furthermore, while the overall security situation has remained calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste officially assumed full responsibility for security on 20 May, smuggling, illegal trade and border crossings, as well as tensions that arose as a result of the July Dili demonstrations, should be considered a matter of concern."	1
"Lack of participation in such institutions impedes progress on specific public administration issues, and does not contribute to improving the international image of Kosovo."	1
"Fortunately, the options before the people of Iraq are neither white nor black nor zero; there is a whole range of compromises that can accommodate the essential concerns of all participants in the political process."	0
"Despite our assessment that it is difficult to achieve a full ceasefire at this time, I remain of the view that the international community must make clear its position on the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for Israel to make a much greater and more reliable effort to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure while establishing the conditions for such a cessation as a matter of urgency."	1
"The review of the security situation contained in the special report of the Secretary-General (S/2008/434) suggests that, despite the tireless efforts of the Afghan people and the international community, serious challenges to peace and stabilization in Afghanistan remain."	0
"On 4 March, he called for the issuance of arrest warrants against State officials, provoking popular outrage and weakening hopes for peace and stability."	1
"Mr. Eide: I do not think that I have any questions, but I would like to make a few comments."	0
"We are also concerned about the recurrence of cholera cases, although the mortality rate appears to be declining slowly."	1
"Tent camps have been closed and internally displaced persons are returning to a normal life, although there are still some problems that require a rapid response."	0
Measures to overcome those shortcomings must address both immediate needs and structural deficits.	0
The President (spoke in French): I now give the floor to Ambassador Jose Filipe Moraes Cabral of Portugal in his capacity as Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.	0
"However, in 2007, following the issuance of arrest warrants against Harun and Kushayb, President Al-Bashir publicly rejected their application, challenged the authority of the Security Council and stated that Harun had done what was ordered of him."	1
The current political situation in Kosovo reflects realities that run counter to those basic premises; we hope that this will only be part of the learning process of democratic stabilization.	0
"In this context, it reaffirms that the primary cause of the crisis in Angola is the refusal of UNITA to comply with the basic provisions of the Lusaka Protocol and reiterates its demand that UNITA comply with its obligations to demilitarize and allow the extension of State administration to the territories under its control."	1
"The President emphatically described the unfortunate incident as unpleasant and unacceptable, foretelling possible violence during the upcoming 2012 elections."	1
"As the presidential elections approach, the security situation becomes even more necessary and urgent."	0
"The Democratic Change Movement candidate has little or no access to Zimbabwean media; it is prohibited to campaign freely; and there are reports that the State has confiscated buses and campaign vehicles, allegedly because they were not properly registered."	1
Bosnia and Herzegovina expresses concern at the current political impasse in the establishment of a new government and the definition of a clear constitutional reform process.	1
We must recognize that we are very concerned about the current situation in Afghanistan.	1
"Emphasis should be placed on the United Nations zero-tolerance policy for such actions, and there should be no impunity for those guilty of such crimes."	0
"We have come to the Council on several occasions to urge Israel to cease its military attacks, to ensure the protection of the civilian population and to put an end to the illegal punitive measures that are causing a deliberate human catastrophe in the Gaza Strip."	1
Cuba is once again appearing before the Security Council to denounce and condemn in the strongest terms the complicity and absolute responsibility of the United States Government with the liberation of this individual.	1
Africans have clearly expressed their concerns regarding the situation in Zimbabwe.	1

"Moreover, the negative effects are also evident outside its borders and not only on the African continent."	0
The European Union is deeply concerned about the cycle of fierce violence currently taking place in Israel and in the occupied territories.	1
President Al-Bashir took diplomatic reprisals against Kenya and threatened it with economic and trade sanctions.	1
"During those considerations, the Chinese delegation had always stressed its view that the question of Darfur involved a political process, the deployment of peacekeepers, economic development, humanitarian assistance and justice; it was very complex and required enormous political wisdom to find a comprehensive solution that would ensure the achievement of peace and justice."	0
"While a leader can be overthrown in a few months, the establishment of a democratic society requires more time and more sacrifice."	0
"Otherwise, we will be able to witness more violent ruptures when the people demand rights that no coercion will convince them to abandon."	0
"In that context, we consider it important to bring to the attention of the Security Council the serious threats posed by radical and extremist religious organizations such as Hizb ut-Tahir, and to urge the Council to impose the strongest possible sanctions against terrorist organizations."	1
"I must report, with great concern, an escalation in criminal acts and attacks against United Nations and humanitarian personnel."	1
"In addition, Israel has regularly continued air violations of the Blue Line, which is a direct violation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)."	1
The Government of Brazil follows closely the efforts of the Government of Haiti to prepare for institutional reforms.	0
"In that regard, we have taken note of the statements made by the main elected representatives of Kosovo, who immediately condemned the crime and called for those responsible to be brought to justice."	1
"In accordance with the understanding reached among the members of the Council, I would like to remind speakers that they should limit their statements to a maximum of five minutes, so that the Council can carry out its work expeditiously."	0
"It is incumbent on the peoples and leaders of the region to resist demagogic appeals, forge and establish coalitions, continue to rely on their system, even if they lose the elections, and defend the principles and institutions that will ultimately protect them."	0
We believe that Palestine will remain the greatest challenge in the Middle East.	0
These priorities relate directly to the credibility of the Executive Directorate.	0
"The international community must therefore take the necessary steps to prevent Israel from persisting in the deplorable destructive policy it had undertaken in Gaza, and it must stress its rejection of all such Israeli practices, which violated international law and international humanitarian law."	1
"Although unpredictable, these changes are proof of an old rule of politics: the inability to introduce reforms provokes revolutions."	0
This issue has never ceased to concern us.	1
"While the 60-year-old solution to the Palestinian tragedy would have profound consequences for the situation in the Middle East, peace in the region also requires progress on other tracks of the peace process."	0
"That is why I have also deliberately omitted to touch on other issues that some would consider mandatory when talking about the Middle East, such as the imperative to overcome the conflict between Israel and Palestine or the situation in Syria, as we have addressed those issues at other Council meetings."	0
The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.	0
But we are also against extrajudicial executions and condemn them.	1
We condemn all ethnically motivated acts and crimes in Kosovo.	1
"However, we do not believe that sovereignty demands that the Council remain silent when Governments slaughter their own people, threatening regional peace and security in that process."	1
No one in the region is free of the demands for change we have seen.	0
The security problems in the Sahelo-Saharan region are not new.	0
"Here, too, we perceive reactions that seemed to justify our concerns."	0

"We must avoid giving easy answers and affirm that the Sahel has always faced such challenges, when, in fact, it is well known that before the challenges were not of that magnitude."	0

"The nature of the terrorist threat differs from State to State, from region to region, as well as the capabilities and needs of States in the fight against terrorism."	0
"The international security guarantors in Timor-Leste, the International Stabilization Force (ISF) and UNMIT no longer face the same difficulties of two or three years ago."	0
Azerbaijan's refusal to engage in direct negotiations with the elected representatives of Nagorny Karabakh is one of the main impediments to the settlement of the conflict to which the representative of Azerbaijan referred.	1

"On the humanitarian situation, we are concerned that, according to reports from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 20 million people in the Sahel region need humanitarian assistance, particularly Mauritania, the Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad."	1
The first concerns the fight against impunity.	0
"Secondly, there are fears regarding the deterioration of confidence between the opposition and the ruling party."	0
"From that point of view, the restoration of peace, security and national unity are the first challenges to be faced."	0
We are also concerned about the very high unemployment rate and the widespread poverty in the country.	1
"A comprehensive approach, fully under Afghan responsibility, is essential to meet that challenge."	0
"The first point concerns the situation on the ground, which is clearly worrying."	0
"To meet these standards, more powers and responsibilities must be transferred to local authorities and privatization must be accelerated."	0
"After initial hesitations, the party chose to resolve this challenge under the law and in accordance with the constitution of its own party by holding new elections for its party delegates."	0
"We have considered that this process should be conducted in a manner that allows all Afghans equally to participate in the elections, while taking into account the security challenges we face."	0
Aspects have also been raised regarding the definition of the roles and responsibilities of PNTL and the Falintil-Forças de Defesa de Timor-Leste.	0
"Thirdly, the humanitarian situation in Somalia remains a cause for concern."	0

Cholera remains a real threat.	0
"Since the beginning of the political impasse, following the elections of 29 March, the Secretary-General has expressed concern about the process and politically motivated violence."	1

"Peace, security and stability in that nation require, first and foremost, the elimination of poverty and underdevelopment."	0
"However, much more needs to be done, particularly in the areas of security, law enforcement, Government capacity, development, the private sector and the personal security of all Afghan citizens."	0

"The first edition, published in 2002, noted that lack of freedom in the Arab world undermined human development and was one of the most painful manifestations of the delay in political development."	0
The situation along the Lebanese-Syrian border also remains a matter of concern.	1
"However, we must not be mistaken: this is a challenge for the whole of Kosovo, not just for a minority."	0
"Some allegations in the press are based on mere speculation, and it is important that the investigation be carried out with the calmness demanded by this kind of situation."	0
Somalis should assume responsibility for ensuring their own security and establishing their own justice system in order to deal with threats to their security.	0
""" The Security Council also expresses its concern at the growing tensions in the Ituri region and calls on all parties to exercise restraint."	1
The state of the Blue Nile remains a concern for us.	1

I am very concerned about the latest escalation between Gaza and Israel.	1
"It is clear that these circumstances represent the greatest obstacle to stability and progress in Afghanistan and that, if allowed to continue, they threaten to undermine the progress achieved over almost three years."	1
Promoting security and stability remains a key challenge.	1
"However, the process has also highlighted how important the challenges remain in Liberia's security sector, especially with regard to the logistics, communications and mobility capabilities of the police and immigration services."	1
Pakistan is deeply concerned about the report's conclusion that the humanitarian and economic challenges facing the Sahel region have been exacerbated as a sequel to the Libyan crisis.	1

We know that civil society organisations have expressed serious concerns in this regard.	1
It is clear that all law and order institutions face serious challenges.	1
"Political pressure on UNMIK has increased significantly, and attempts have been made to challenge its role under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework."	1
Today we have no doubt that the real intention was to prevent the details of his vandalism while acting under the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency.	1
"The Government also shares a number of concerns expressed in the report that relate, inter alia, to human rights and the situation of children and women."	1
"We are seriously concerned about this decree, which can have far-reaching consequences."	1
"However, we believe that abrupt withdrawal would be counterproductive and create an unprecedented vacuum, especially in view of the fact that the conditions for long-awaited large-scale investment and sustainable development do not exist."	1
"At the outset, I would like to express our deep concern about the security situation in the country."	1
"I must say that the subject you have set for our debate today, although exciting, is a great challenge."	1
"As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/634), this is a truly daunting challenge."	1

I urge Hamas to respond positively to these calls.	1

"Unfortunately, the current Palestinian leaders have shown that they are as incapable of being partners in peace as they are of offering their people reform and democratic governance."	1
"First, security concerns remain paramount."	1
It is clear that the situation in Darfur does not qualify for the implementation of these provisions.	1
"First, while Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West African Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere is impeding data sharing and early warning."	1
France strongly condemns this attack and calls upon all parties to exercise the utmost restraint.	1
"The political debate is likely to intensify, as several elections-related appeals have already been submitted to the courts."	1
"The report confirms a worrying picture of the situation in the Sahel region and related security, economic and humanitarian issues."	1
"Secondly, he expressed concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority -- the Kosovo Serbs -- runs the risk of being overcome in a vote, I would say that I believe that the most important aspect of democracy is indeed the possibility of participation, of exercising the rights of a democracy and voting."	1
We have expressed our serious concern about the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	1

We urge all parties to exercise restraint and to avoid any actions or pronouncements that might incite further violence.	1
The United States calls on the Haitian authorities to fulfil their commitment to fill the six Supreme Court vacancies by 3 October 2011.	1

The challenges facing the country require Haitian leaders to forge a common bond.	1
"However, there is still potential for a total collapse of public order, in addition to a collapse of the fragile economy and a disintegration of autonomous institutions."	1
"The negative effects of the situation in Libya will continue to increase, posing a sustained threat to peace and stability in the region, and China expresses its deep concern in this regard."	1
"It remains a matter of great concern to me that the efforts of Liberians to rebuild their court system will take a long time, so that the system itself is likely to remain fragile and easy to penetrate in the short term."	1
"In 1993, that vision was blurred, to say the least, and at that time it was impossible to define the final objectives that would approach the concerns of both peoples."	1
"We have taken note of the caution of the Secretary-General and the technical assessment mission with regard to security sector reform, and especially with regard to PNTL."	1
"These false accusations contradict the basic reason and standards of a professional attitude, and I am sure that the Council will reject them."	1
"There is considerable interest in the implementation of the joint communiqué of 2 April 2009, referred to in the report."	1
"This has led to high tensions with local communities, as well as threats against MONUC by former CNDP military commanders now integrated into FARDC."	1
We believe that it is unacceptable for us to deviate from that principle as the fragile situation in the province could be plunged into widespread destabilization.	1
"The voices of Haitian political leaders and civil society actors continue to rise, calling for a national consensus to be reached to move forward in key areas such as the national budget, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and constitutional reform."	1

"However, we remain concerned that too much emphasis is placed on visits to developing countries."	1
"As UNAMA, we would be irresponsible if we did not urge the international community, the Governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan and international forces to end this situation, especially on the southern border."	1
"While Hizbollah's actions are deplorable and, as I have already said, Israel has the right to self-defence, the excessive use of force must be condemned."	1
"The new democratic Government of Pakistan has inherited enormous political, economic and security problems."	1
"Sustained developments in that direction would jeopardize efforts to restore and rebuild the country and, in the long term, threaten peace and stability throughout the region."	1
We have fenced a 25-kilometre stretch of border and installed searchlights and video cameras at the border crossings.	0
"As members of the Council are aware, migration from North to South has begun and, for the first time, will represent the crossing of an international border."	0

The meeting was called to order at 10.55 a.m.	0
I am particularly concerned about the present unstable situation that could deteriorate further if the political situation does not change and if the socio-economic situation continues to be unmet.	1
"The United States must desist from this deliberate disregard, a practice that it has maintained for almost seven years and has led to the deterioration of the situation in the region."	1

We are also concerned about the situation faced by those who are now involved in the reconstruction of the country.	1
We are very concerned about the stubborn refusal of leaders of groups such as the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement to participate in the talks.	1
The Council condemns any unilateral action aimed at creating situations on the ground that adversely affect the outcome of the negotiations.	1
"The Council stresses that all those responsible for violations of international law, including humanitarian law and human rights law, as well as those who ordered such acts, shall be held accountable."	1
"Affirmations such as that Palestinians do not love their children or that Palestinians send their children to death because they hate Israel are words full of racism that reflect a kind of attitude that must be flatly rejected, which I am now trying to do."	1
"Blaming others, looking for scapegoats to hold them accountable for failures in Afghanistan and asking those who are already doing more than they should do even more is unfair and unacceptable and will ultimately be counterproductive."	1
We cannot send the message that terrorists will be immune and we will be satisfied with regular convictions.	1
"Many achievements have been made, but many challenges remain."	0
The recent publication by the Council of Ulemas of a religious decree condemning drug trafficking and other related activities can be instrumental in discouraging opium poppy cultivation.	1
We therefore encourage the members of the Council and also of the Group of Friends to look favourably at these recommendations of the Secretary-General.	1
It seems that the population not only aspires but demands that more plural and representative governments generate tangible benefits for citizenship.	1
"Timor-Leste continues to face major challenges related to poverty reduction and job creation, particularly for young people."	1
"In the light of recent experiences, it is also clear that the Court will continue to face some serious problems."	0

"We note that, in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo."	1
Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continuing illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.	1
We were therefore frustrated that the Secretary-General's report recommended only a partial reduction in reinforcement troops.	1
"Now, however, what Afghanistan has accomplished is considerably undermined by serious challenges to its security and stability."	1
"While air piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a serious problem, we ask the international community not to forget that the solution must be found on land rather than at sea. The comprehensive resolution of the Somali conflict must address all the causes of piracy and other problems, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic wastes."	1
The second point I would like to address today is our continued concern for the well-being of innocent people in Gaza and in the towns and cities of southern Israel.	1
"Finally, Afghans urgently need to take the lead in the fight against drugs."	1
I also condemn Hizbollah's reckless disregard for the wishes of the elected Government of Lebanon and for the interests of the Lebanese people and the region in general.	1
"“The Security Council strongly condemns the terrorist attacks in Algiers on 11 December 2007 in the vicinity of the Supreme Court and the United Nations offices, which have caused numerous deaths and injuries, and expresses its deep regret and condolences to the victims of this heinous act of terrorism and their families, as well as to the people and Government of Algeria."	1
The meeting was called to order at 4.05 p.m.	0
"I also recall how unpopular it was to speak to Israelis about the 1967 borders, and it was for a long time almost inconceivable to propose the evacuation of Israeli settlements."	1
The latest report of the Secretary-General on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) clearly expresses the importance of the disarmament of Hizbollah and the end of arms smuggling on the Lebanese-Syrian borders.	1
"Needless to say, there are currently no patterns of sexual violence in Kenya, and none of the reported activities related to our country occurred during the reporting period from 2010 to 2011."	0

"Indeed, more than half of the African issues of interest to the Council on its agenda relate to the countries of the Great Lakes region: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, northern Uganda, the Sudan and the Central African Republic."	0
Today's debate is about an urgent matter.	1
It is essential that cases of domestic violence and sexual assault are formally prosecuted in accordance with the penal code.	1
"That is perhaps the result of the urgency and also of the very limitations of this Council, as an intergovernmental political body of a fundamentally executive nature."	0
"It demands that Israel, the occupying Power, abide by all the rules of international law and the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, in addition to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly."	0
This basic obligation is breached by some States without any consequences for their anti-legal conduct.	1
"I hoped that today the new Special Coordinator could accompany us, but the Secretary-General sent him urgently to the region."	0
"On several occasions, our country has expressed its concern about the civilian population in that area and the importance of MONUC deploying there to protect it."	1
"The incident in North Mitrovica clearly demonstrated that, despite the Security Council's mandate on the reconfiguration of UNMIK, EULEX is increasingly moving away from the principle of status neutrality, which is detrimental to the position of the international presence."	1
