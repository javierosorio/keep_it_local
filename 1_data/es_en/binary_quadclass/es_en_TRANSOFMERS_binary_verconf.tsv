As Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council and as one of the first promoters of the Global Coalition against Terrorism, the Republic of Croatia strongly condemns international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and, bearing in mind the danger that terrorism will be countered by other threats to international peace and security -- such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, transnational organized crime and cyber terrorism -- calls for stronger cooperation at the global level for the suppression of this scourge of today.	1

The personal interests of those who oppose the establishment of a legitimate government have always been present and the Monitoring Group has highlighted in its previous reports this central problem in Somalia, which continues to exist and has become the main theme of its third report: primarily, the continuing trend towards the intensification of possible violence to protect deep-rooted vested interests.	1
Thus, for example, the ruling in the Jagre al-Jadi al-Makbul et al. case describes how a combination of 39 policemen and members of the Popular Armed Forces left the inhabitants of Thabit at the mercy of a large contingent of Fursan attackers.	1

Members of the Council expressed their deep concern at the continuing crimes in Libya.	1
We strongly condemn these practices, which constitute a flagrant violation of international norms and humanitarian law, and we therefore urge the international community, the Quartet and all others concerned to intervene immediately and decisively to demand that Israel put an end to such acts, which pose a serious threat to peace and security in the Middle East region; violence only generates violence; the region will be trapped in a vicious circle from which it will find it difficult to escape.	1
By contemplating initiatives that in fact reward this strategy, the Council would only embolden extremists and undermine the letter and spirit of the road map.	1
Mr. Å imonoviÄ believed that accountability was essential to reconciliation and that efforts should also be made to prosecute members of armed groups who had committed serious human rights violations.	0

We were even hampered in condemning the violence and in adopting a peaceful plan drawn up by Syria's own neighbours.	1
However, the financial and other institutions involved in implementation do not yet have this change in mind, and the Team recommends that the Committee and States find a way to disseminate it.	0
Despite these challenges, we cannot fail to recognize that approximately 50 per cent of the Afghan population lives in areas where responsibility for security has been transferred to the Afghan security forces.	1

14. Invites the Secretary-General to bring to its attention situations where refugees and internally displaced persons are vulnerable to threats of harassment or where their camps are vulnerable to infiltration by armed elements and where such situations may constitute a threat to international peace and security, expresses in this regard its readiness to examine such situations and, where necessary, to take appropriate measures to contribute to the establishment of a safe environment for civilians threatened by conflict, in particular by providing support to relevant States in this regard, and recalls in this regard its resolution 1208 (1998) of 19 November 1998;	0

The High Representative/Special Representative made it clear that, since the Republika Srpska authorities, in particular the Ministry of the Interior, had not arrested persons against whom war crimes had been charged, and since Bosnia and Herzegovina had not joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Peace Partnership, the Commission would be mandated to make recommendations with a view to establishing a single and effective police structure throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.	1

Instead of the famous 2014 Football World Cup logo, which is made up of three victorious hands that hold the globe forming the prestigious cup, the Palestinian Authority vignette shows a three-handed "trophy" that grabs three people whose arms are raised in a surrendering attitude.	1
There are also procedural obstacles that limit victims'access to justice.	0
At the same time, one of the issues that continues to be raised by the most intense discussions in the subregion is to ensure that counter-terrorism measures respect human rights obligations.	1
Bilateral donor assistance will also be needed to enable a meaningful response to the security threats posed by drug and arms trafficking.	0
1. Deplores and condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist acts of ISIL and its violent extremist ideology, as well as its ongoing, flagrant, systematic and widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law;	1
In addition, the Council itself has set important precedents, in particular the establishment of commissions of inquiry on Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur, which paved the way for the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993 and 1994, respectively, and the referral of the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court in 2005.	0
The Council reaffirms, recalls or reiterates regularly its demand for States to implement existing arms embargoes, because implementation remains a major challenge.	1
As explained below, the Commission has collected a great deal of material which, in its view, confirms that the term Janjaweed, within the limited context of the Commission's mandate, is used as a generic term to describe the Arab militia acting under the orders of the Sudanese State authorities, with their support, complicity or consent and whose acts go unpunished.	0
As for the condition that an attack must be "systematic", it is required that the acts be organized and that they are not likely to occur at random.	0
However, they also expressed concern that every time there is a sign of hope in the Middle East there is an escalation of violence and destruction.	1
However, the determinant of genocidal intent, at least as far as the central government authorities are concerned, seems to be missing.	1
Security sector reform remains a major challenge for long-term peace and stability.	1
I remain concerned about the continued restriction of access of ordinary citizens in the north of Mali to basic services, including health-care services and schools.	1
The technical meeting convened to discuss the Internet at the International Summit on Democracy, Terrorism and Security concluded that the Internet should remain free from any new regulation or interference, allowing open debate to defeat the ideas of extremism.	0

United Nations peace operations have changed their positions accordingly and show an increasing tendency to shield and entrench themselves, limiting the ability of both uniformed and civilian personnel to interact with the local population, reach their hearts and minds, mediate local disputes and obtain information -- critical work for the implementation of peace agreements and efforts to resolve conflicts.	1
While training of FARDC and PNC units remains essential, any training programme for FARDC should be linked to the establishment of an army supply chain in order to ensure the sustainability of the efforts and investments made.	0
:: Consider and implement more effective means of collecting outstanding information	0
As the representative of Algeria had previously said, the draft resolution, which had not been adopted, contained a clear condemnation of all terrorist attacks against civilians, as well as all acts of violence and destruction.	1
The improvement of relations between Chad and the Sudan and the monitoring of national security forces and joint border security forces have also been cited as important factors contributing to this.	0
In this context, I turn next to the resolution on Yemen recently adopted quite late by the Council, which is a condemnation of the abuses committed by the Yemeni Government.	1

âThe Security Council considers that terrorist havens remain a matter of serious concern, and reaffirms the need for States to strengthen their cooperation in order to find, deny safe haven and bring to justice, on the basis of the principle of extradition or prosecution, any person who supports, facilitates, participates in or attempts to participate in the financing, planning, preparation or commission of terrorist acts or who facilitates safe haven.	1

Non-conventional threat: chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear explosives, Asia	0
There is another, more concrete reason why the political and military leaders of the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement cannot refuse to accept responsibility for the crimes committed by their troops on the battlefield if they refrained from preventing or suppressing their commission.	1
“The Security Council notes with deep concern the humanitarian consequences of the conflict on the people of Angola.	1

There is concern about the deterioration in the standard of living of the population as a consequence of the difficulties that had to be faced in 2008, in particular the global food crisis and the scourge of hurricanes that ravaged the island.	1
Moreover, neither the characteristics nor the flight manoeuvres of the aircraft prior to the attacks can in any way be interpreted as warning signals, as they were clearly part of the attacks.	0
Unfortunately, the Sudanese judicial system has demonstrated that it cannot and will not investigate and prosecute the alleged perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur.	1
Noting the release of the remaining 404 Moroccan prisoners of war by the Frente POLISARIO on 18 August 2005, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and calling upon the parties to continue to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross in order to determine the fate of those who remain unaccounted for since the beginning of the conflict,	0
At the end of this fourth round of talks, the parties reiterated their commitment to continue negotiations in Manhasset at a date to be agreed upon.	0

The Mission arrived in Daloa by road, escorted by a detachment of the Ivorian army.	0
In no way can it be interpreted that the conclusion that the Government authorities did not promote or implement a policy of genocide in Darfur, directly or through the militia under their control, means that the crimes committed in that region have been less serious.	1
We are particularly concerned about the very small number of refugee returns, which are the most useful indicators for assessing the situation in the province.	1
In reviewing the evolving risk of incitement, it should be borne in mind that the media and forms of communication have evolved substantially since the adoption of resolution 1624 (2005).	1

At the same time, despite the promises of the democratic transition process, it should not be forgotten that this is a highly responsible stage in the history of the Middle East, which requires maximum vigilance and hard work in order to rule out miscalculation and unpredictability of the future of the region.	1
This is another example of a joint attack planned and organized by Government forces and the Janjaweed, during which mass killings and summary executions were committed.	0
I am very concerned about the latest escalation between Gaza and Israel.	1
It is therefore important that States keep this aspect of the embargo in mind, and the Committee may wish to remind them of this in due course, encouraging them to submit the names of those who provide âtechnical advice, assistance or training related to military activitiesâ (resolution 1617 (2005), para. 1 (c) in contravention of the measures, for inclusion on the list.	1

The Russian Federation expresses its deep regret and concern at the information regarding the persistence of violence in Darfur.	1
In its fourteenth report, the Team considered the threat of Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaida affiliate in Somalia-based East Africa, to launch attacks against regional Governments and the international community (S/2013/467, para. 10).	1

As this threat increases, the response of the international community must evolve and keep pace.	1
To take no action on such a dangerous group on the unfortunate pretext that it poses no threat from the Government is to renounce the essential responsibility of any State, that is, to ensure the security of its citizens.	1
The Chairman, together with the Chairmen of the Committees established pursuant to resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004), which also deal with counter-terrorism issues, held two joint briefings with the Security Council in 2009.

In its preliminary report, the Commission established similarities and differences in mandates, noting in particular that, while it had determined the existence of some violations that led it to conclude that international crimes had been committed in Libya, it was for the International Criminal Court to assess individual criminal responsibility.	1
At least 70 important members of the People's Congress party are currently in detention without charge or trial, and several have left the Sudan and gone into exile.	0
