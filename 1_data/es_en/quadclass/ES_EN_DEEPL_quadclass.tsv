2007/s/pv_5693/88:2	Significant progress has been made, but the complex political, economic and security climate continues to present enormous challenges to the elected leaders charged with the normalization of our country.	3

2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/406:1	The arguments of the representative of Armenia are particularly striking because he has presented them before the Security Council, which, in 1993, adopted four resolutions condemning the use of force against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its territories and demanding the immediate, total and unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian occupation forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan (resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993)).	3

2008/s/pv_6049/108:1	Given the persistence of these complexities and such behavior that is totally contrary to what is required to reach a just solution, we must ask ourselves: How can we successfully conclude the peace process in the year 2009? We believe that the Quartet and the Security Council have a responsibility to devise a practical mechanism to deal with the issues in a situation where one party repeatedly ignores appeals and fails to fulfill its obligations, putting us into a cyclical process with no conclusion in sight.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/146:5	The resolution reiterates the importance of complying with these obligations and emphasizes that neither party should undertake any activity that would contravene these obligations or prejudice the final status negotiations.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/146:3	We consider the issue of strengthening government legitimacy to be crucial, as a cause and effect relationship has been established between such legitimacy and the elimination of resistance by the informal actors and networks that characterize the nature of power in Afghanistan.	3

2012/s/pv_6734/270:1	In this regard, I would like to stress once again that, unlike other well-known situations involving unfounded and illegitimate territorial claims, including those under the fabricated pretext of serving ethnic minority groups, the right to self-determination and statehood of the Palestinian people has been recognized.	3

2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/275:2	These actions can be considered as an indirect participation in misleading public opinion and disregarding the position of the Syrian Government with regard to the events in its own territory.

2003/s/pv_4770/171:2	The leaders of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government often shirk their responsibilities under Resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/200:1	Among these concerns, one must be highlighted: the deterioration of the security situation in recent weeks and months.	3

2011/s/pv_6618/119:1	"""antagonism between political forces overshadows the country's recent democratic success and threatens its progress towards permanent stability."" (S/2011/540, para. 55)"	3
2008/s/pv_5930/308:1	In conclusion, the challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous, but we are making progress.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/123:2	The deterioration of the population's standard of living is of concern as a result of the difficulties that had to be faced in 2008, particularly due to the global food crisis and the scourge of hurricanes that devastated the island.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/255:1	However, they also expressed concern that every time there is a sign of hope in the Middle East there is an escalation of violence and destruction.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/99:2	"In particular, I would like to emphasize that the Taliban -- as your report concludes -- remain a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and containing them is an essential aspect."""	3
2012/s/pv_6735/124:1	However, the country continues to face challenges in its struggle to achieve stability and development, including the security situation, the worsening humanitarian situation, challenges in the areas of rule of law and human rights, and the incessant violence that has resulted in civilian deaths, which continues to increase.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/289:1	Fourth, piracy off the coast of Somalia is an international problem, which requires our collective efforts and contribution.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/144:2	The Secretary General unequivocally warns that none of the eight standards have been fully met to date.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/72:2	We categorically condemn this morning's ruthless attack on the shrines of Imam Ali al-Hadi and Imam Hassan al-Askari in Samarra, and share the outrage of the Iraqi people over this crime, which is another deliberate attempt by Al-Qaida to sow dissension and pit religious currents against each other in Iraq.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/57:6	This means that the secessionists continue to flagrantly disregard international law, thus rejecting the universal principles of the United Nations Charter.	3
2006/s/pv_5466/50:3	We emphasize the tragic consequences that these messages have had recently in other parts of the continent.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/77:3	However, make no mistake: my country is also prepared to resist unceasingly the unilateral declaration of independence as long as a compromise solution is not in sight.	3
2011/s/pv_6566/47:2	As of June 23, more than 1.1 million people had crossed Libya's borders into Tunisia, Egypt, Niger, Algeria, Chad and Sudan.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 3:15 p.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/67:4	The administrative reform at the national level does not represent an improvement to date.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/171:1	We highlight the issue of violence to express our impatience with the urgency of finding satisfactory solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/65:1	I am concerned that this vote and stalemate in Parliament could undermine the important gains that Somali stakeholders and their partners have made.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/75:5	In all these conversations, I was encouraged to find a convergence of views: we all marveled at the many advances Liberia has made since the fighting ended in 2003, but we all fully realized how daunting the challenges Liberia still faces are and that, ultimately, we can take nothing for granted.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/98:4	Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian Special Court process, additional remedial action would be necessary to ensure that justice is done.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/61:4	It is unacceptable and, moreover, contravenes the ban on landmines that the anti-government forces publicly declared.	3
2011/s/pv_6490/49:2	In his public statements, Colonel Khaddafi and his family members have continued to threaten citizens with civil war and the possibility of mass killings if protests continue.	3
2010/s/pv_6444/52:2	The Council condemns all attacks perpetrated by local and foreign armed groups that threaten the population, and endanger the peace and stability of the Central African Republic and the sub-region, including the attacks against Birao perpetrated by the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace on July 19 and November 24.	3
2006/s/pv_5492/42:1	The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon -- which was certified by this Council six years ago -- would result in security along its northern border, find themselves under constant rocket attacks by Hezbollah, which are penetrating deeper into Israeli territory every day.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/228:5	There has been an increase in the number of attacks against national and international security forces, officials of public institutions and humanitarian personnel. There has been an increase in the number of attacks against polling stations and threats against registration teams.	3
2009/s/pv_6111/60:4	This was made clear in the recent incidents of DIS indiscipline, namely the alleged killing of a civilian by a DIS commander in Farchana on March 22.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/309:2	We note that the enduring challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/137:1	At the same time, my delegation believes that the elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, in particular the Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their electorate if they adopted a more participatory attitude, instead of withdrawing from the legislature when faced with a difficult situation.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/229:2	We should not underestimate the threat posed in Afghanistan by the destabilizing activities of the Taliban and Al-Qaida.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/57:2	Although neither side seems willing to return to war, there is a worrying pattern of escalating tension and destabilization that could lead to a full-scale confrontation and endanger civilian lives.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/140:2	Nevertheless, the situation inside Kosovo is still worrisome.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/179:1	Like other speakers before us and in tune with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the act that led to the death of Mr. Dzeković and others being injured during the protests that took place on July 2 in northern Mitrovica.	3
2007/s/pv_5718/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 11:25 a.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/151:1	We urge Israel to end its military incursions into Gaza.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/124:3	South Africa stresses that, in view of the magnitude of these challenges, a comprehensive strategy incorporating security, humanitarian assistance, good governance and socio-economic development is needed.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/56:1	Recent events in the region confirm the concerns consistently conveyed to the mission by its interlocutors.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/199:1	We have also noted that the spiral of violence has driven entire populations to move to escape the violence.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/186:2	Such acts are absolutely unacceptable. The Palestinian Authority must stop these attacks and prosecute the perpetrators.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/252:1	During our previous debate, Belgium shared the concern expressed by the Secretary General about the dangers of violence in Iraq for a society, institutions and a political process that remain fragile.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/138:2	We urge the Palestinian Authority to do everything possible to put an end to these attacks.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/216:1	In conclusion, while Timor-Leste has made significant progress, it still faces many serious challenges in its efforts to establish a stable democracy and develop its economy.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/252:5	The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees of its security as a state.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/187:2	This is obviously because the States in question rejected their measures.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/387:2	It is important to give women, who are the first victims of violence in all its manifestations, a leading role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and it is even more important and urgent to do so in the process of conflict prevention.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/52:4	However, challenges remain on the road to lasting peace and stabilization in Darfur.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/171:4	These actions have been undertaken despite the position clearly taken against them by the Special Representative of the Secretary General and in defiance of the provisions of the United Nations and the Security Council.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/124:2	The alarming drug trafficking situation calls for additional measures.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/233:1	The challenge is to ensure that our outrage translates into determined and resolute action that bears quick and measurable fruit.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/254:4	They insist on treating the case as a simple immigration crime.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/97:2	I repeat today what I said last January 31 (see S/PV.6710) it is unacceptable to prevent the Council from assuming its responsibilities.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/168:2	Your mission represents the last chance to prevent a crisis from erupting in Syria.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/353:5	All this occurred despite repeated condemnations of such inhumane acts in Council Resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), resolutions that became beacons of hope for millions of abused women and girls around the world.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/66:5	The second is to call once again, as a matter of urgency, for the Security Council to take indispensable measures to stop the bloodshed in Syria.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/273:1	In the face of this clear situation of threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without the double standards that characterize it in this matter and adopt, urgently and decisively, the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the countries that make up the Arab Group.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/40:1	The President: In accordance with standard practice, I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/324:2	In our view, it is not infiltration across borders that is resulting in extremist violence in Afghanistan, including in the south and southeast.	0
2010/s/pv_6431/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 4:10 p.m.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/253:1	The report before us makes for difficult reading, but it also sets out a challenge.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/291:1	In conclusion, in the context of world peace and the Middle East, I would like to emphasize that, while we understand all the different needs that emanate from security, it would be better for that region and for the whole world if the Iran situation could be prevented from escalating into a conflict, because it would be the kind of conflict that would have very unfortunate repercussions for the world and could be the straw that breaks the camel's back -- as the proverb says -- of world peace.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/153:1	We are deeply concerned that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated by one side against the other, despite the fact that the international community and the Security Council have made it clear that they abhor this situation.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/176:3	In order to complete the transfer process, a number of logistical requirements must be met.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/317:3	Given its current political status, Kosovo remains far from foreign direct investment and is not eligible to benefit from International Monetary Fund and World Bank programs and assistance, which would have a direct impact on the development of a stable and efficient economy.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/215:4	This is an important step in the right direction.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/56:3	In addition, tensions on the border could lead to serious violence during the migration period, particularly in the Abyei area, from which neither side has fully withdrawn.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/97:3	This would entail stronger measures regarding the eviction of those who, with the threat of violence, are using Serbian property illegally.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/71:2	The first is that the demands for human rights and freedom are universal and will spread by themselves over time, as they are fundamental human aspirations.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/195:7	We urge all Member States to take immediate action to comply with the obligation contained in resolution 2036 (2012) to prohibit trade in Somali charcoal, particularly by those elements most active in such trade.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/172:6	Israel has legitimate security concerns, but these can only be fully and effectively addressed through a negotiated agreement.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/230:1	At the same time, we are concerned about the observation in the report that the work on demarcation of the land border between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is not being carried out expeditiously.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/65:2	This is important to strengthen the Mission's capacity to provide genuine protection to the Congolese civilian population, victims of an obvious humanitarian disaster, as Mr. Doss emphasized, and of massive human rights violations, in particular acts of violence directed against women and children.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/185:1	Given its role as a country at the forefront of these efforts, the United Kingdom knows, perhaps better than others around this table, how immense the long-term challenge of counter-narcotics is.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/114:2	That is why I have focused more on the opportunities than on the challenges in my speech.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/220:1	Measures that could undermine confidence or damage the outcome of negotiations should be suspended and reversed.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/219:4	The siege must be lifted immediately so that the civilian population in Gaza can have access, essentially to water, jobs, commerce, medical care and education, in short, access to their basic needs.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/263:1	I would like to remind speakers to limit their statements to a maximum of four minutes so that the Council can carry out its work expeditiously.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/218:1	My delegation is concerned that the security situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/151:3	We must reject any attempt to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/92:3	Therefore, the terrorists have failed to achieve their strategic objective of preventing many volunteers from coming to rebuild the country.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/135:3	We were hindered from even condemning the violence and approving a peaceful plan drawn up by Syria's own neighbors.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/93:1	The fact that both parties, the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan, employ rhetoric with intensity is cause for concern.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/247:1	Egypt once again demands that Israel immediately cease its attacks on Gaza.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/246:3	The statement outlines issues of concern and towards the end contains an urgent appeal by Somali women to the international community to raise gender issues, including with Somali leaders.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/185:1	Despite overall progress, it should be noted that poverty and unemployment remain a formidable challenge, as highlighted by Ms. Ameerah Haq.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/255:2	We are gravely concerned that the special processes created for this purpose seem to have failed.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/51:2	However, the challenges involved will be much greater, as they will be one-day events, and logistics will be hampered by Liberia's heavy rainy season.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/252:2	The Chad experience, however, left a strong imprint on our peacekeeping forces and a greater awareness of the challenge facing the United Nations in this regard.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/111:4	Combating this scourge requires strengthening our criminal prosecution capacity, our judicial system, our civil police and even our penitentiary system.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/257:2	We have noted with concern that the Secretary General believes that many of the factors that fueled the 2006 crisis are still present in society, making it vulnerable to instability.	3
2011/s/pv_6490/42:1	We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d'Ivoire, as the Council may have noticed from my statement this morning.	3
2002/s/pv_4583/45:2	It also stresses that Rwanda has an obligation to use its considerable influence to ensure that CCD-Goma does not carry out any such actions.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/68:1	National security forces are not yet able to respond to these threats in remote areas due to their limited capacity.	0
2012/s/pv_6708/46:4	The important challenges and problems related to security and national reconciliation should not be underestimated and, in my opinion, require the political attention of the Council.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/260:2	In compliance with these resolutions, this body should demand that the Government of the United States immediately try Luis Posada Carriles for his terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose justice system has been demanding his extradition for years.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/154:2	The Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations should make more efforts in prevention activities, such as the provision of drinking water and sanitation.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/46:1	The Security Council expresses grave concern over reports of an unusual and sudden influx of thousands of Misseriya into the city of Abyei and its environs, a phenomenon that could force major changes in the ethnic composition of the area.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/361:2	We must now expedite the work related to our mutual obligations.	0
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/137:2	Indeed, the European Union considers that solid socio-economic development is necessary to sustain and consolidate the new stability.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/216:1	No State in our region, regardless of its internal resources, can meet the challenges of terrorism, secession and development on its own, nor can it guarantee democracy and a spirit of openness.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/251:3	The mission requirements with respect to resolution 1325 (2000) were more specific and detailed during the deployment of the EU military operation than during the subsequent deployment of MINURCAT.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/143:1	As serious and reprehensible as this act was, it was an isolated act.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/135:2	Conflicts in the region have complex root causes involving multiple factors, such as political differences, unequal distribution of economic resources and tribal clashes. The potential for renewed and expanded conflict persists. Achieving peace will continue to require the tireless efforts of all parties.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/174:2	All stakeholders must ensure that Kosovo is a place where ethnic tolerance and multiculturalism allow for peaceful coexistence between communities.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/64:3	I believe that by combining his performance with that of Ambassador Jurica as Chairman of the Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee, our counter-terrorism work has been reinvigorated.	0
2012/s/pv_6708/48:1	In our view, the holding of the legislative elections without delay and in a relatively peaceful atmosphere is a major achievement, marking a major step towards the restoration of constitutional order, a more inclusive government and the completion of a key unfinished aspect of the peace process.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/177:2	People around the world demand their universal human rights.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/191:2	In this regard, the recommendations made by the evaluation team to prevent the spread of conflicts, destabilization of States and worsening humanitarian problems require the utmost attention.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/159:1	We urge Israel to respect its obligations towards the population of the occupied territories.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/330:1	In post-conflict situations, too, the challenges facing women remain enormous.	0
2010/s/pv_6259/68:3	However, failure to actively intervene to restore stability in that country already calls into question the effectiveness of the international community and involves enormous amounts of costly resources.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/140:1	We remain concerned that, despite all attempts to restore peace and security, efforts to stabilize eastern DRC have recently suffered major setbacks.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/82:4	Chile further understands that operative paragraph 2 of the failed draft resolution includes a condemnation of the suicide bombings that have often targeted innocent civilians in Israel.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/109:1	The Republic of South Sudan is extremely concerned about the deteriorating security in the border areas of the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/200:1	The Council notes with concern the problems in the area of socioeconomic development, as the standard of living of the vast majority of Haitians has fallen sharply.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/113:3	We see encouraging signs in this regard and significant achievements in this important endeavor.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/151:4	This is an international obligation that States must comply with in order to help bring justice to the victims of these painful events.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/103:1	Council members should know that all necessary measures have been and will continue to be taken to arrest the culprits as quickly as possible.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/60:2	Not only is the timetable for the next elections already approaching, but the situation on Liberia's border with Côte d'Ivoire is also becoming necessary to monitor closely for possible security implications.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/234:1	In this context, despite the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular taking the fight against terrorism more seriously, there is little evidence of a truly concerted effort to provide a more united international response to terrorism.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/55:1	We know that conflict situations are often characterized by the breakdown of public order.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/224:3	Our main concern in this regard is the fact that, according to the report, none of the eight standards have yet been fully met.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/111:1	Afghanistan will face decisive challenges in the coming months.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/34:1	The situation regarding the Democratic Republic of Congo	0
2009/s/pv_6234/43:1	"""The Security Council notes with concern the postponement of the first round of the presidential elections, the holding of which, scheduled for 29 November 2009, according to the communiqué dated 18 May 2009 of the Permanent Consultative Framework established by the Ouagadougou Political Agreement, had been approved by all the main Ivorian political actors."	3
2012/s/pv_6729/122:2	Monitoring and identification of arms embargo violations should be intensified and targeted sanctions imposed, if necessary, in order to reduce the devastating effects this dynamic can have in the Somali context.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/298:3	Timor-Leste has taken important steps to address this difficult legacy, but considerable and urgent challenges remain.	0
2010/s/pv_6259/66:4	The protection of civilians is a long-ignored obligation in Somalia.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/64:3	The secessionist group of MPs rejected Garowe's process and passed a motion to bring forward the presidential elections from July to April 30 this year.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/73:1	The general problem is to ensure that the gradual measures that have been implemented are intensified and multiplied and become transforming elements.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/134:1	First of all, let me emphasize the importance of taking as a basis the current negotiations, both the Israeli-Palestinian track and the Israeli-Syrian track.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/239:5	However, it is inadmissible to attempt to justify, based on a valid security concern, measures that indiscriminately affect an entire people, in contravention of international humanitarian law.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/252:3	However, we are concerned that key decision making is so far being undermined by a lack of political consensus.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/188:3	Although the region's leaders took bold steps to combat this scourge, the Libyan crisis aggravated the situation.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:3	This gender perspective must be present in the reform and training of all security forces.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/117:1	We note with concern that the area of security continues to be problematic.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/158:1	The first issue is the narcotics situation in Afghanistan, a serious and growing challenge not only for Afghanistan but also for the rest of the world.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/182:2	We are concerned about the lack of political freedoms in these areas.	3
2006/s/pv_5597/80:2	In that context, we reiterate what we state over and over again that the main threat to the investigation is that some parties in our region and elsewhere are taking advantage of it to politicize conclusions that are completely unrelated to the investigation and not based on solid evidence.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/212:1	However, the security situation remains of real concern to all, despite a decrease in security-related incidents in December 2011 and January 2012, compared to the two-month period covered by last year's report.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/177:1	We note that efforts to reform local government have faced delays.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/53:3	Violence and displacement are an immediate challenge to the credibility of the voting process.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/214:2	The fight against impunity is also of utmost importance in the prevention of sexual violence.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/236:2	These activities undermine the weak foundations of the Afghan state and hinder the achievement of lasting stability.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/103:3	At this stage of the peacebuilding process such behavior could be misinterpreted and incite violence, which could lead to a relapse into conflict.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/86:2	The challenge now is to build on that platform and make the promise of peace a reality.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/256:1	South Africa has always been among those States that condemn all acts of violence, terrorism, excessive and indiscriminate use of force and physical destruction of property.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/318:2	This type of interaction allows preventive measures to be taken within a reasonable period of time.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/95:2	Terrorism represents a serious challenge to our security, to the basic principles of democratic societies and to the rights and freedoms of our citizens.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/176:4	However, we are concerned about reports that tensions between the governing party and opposition parties have intensified.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/136:1	Sahelian countries are making progress in their counterterrorism capabilities.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/168:3	The mission's recommendations in this regard require careful consideration.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/220:2	It is essential to avoid any action, activity or statement that could undermine or hinder peace efforts.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/177:5	Local government reform programs should not wait for final status negotiations to begin.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/51:8	Elections held after a protracted conflict seek to create political legitimacy for the post-war order.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/49:3	However, as I said at Tuesday's public meeting, facts have to be seen in context, and the Security Council does nothing to contribute to a peaceful solution when it condemns the actions of one side and turns a blind eye to everything else going on in the region.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/65:1	Perhaps the main long-term challenges for Timor-Leste will be socioeconomic.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/272:3	At the same time, Cuba expresses its condemnation of the suicide bombings and other acts directed against Israeli civilians, innocent victims of the spiral of violence caused by the policy of its Government, while opposing the manipulation of such isolated acts to question the exercise of legitimate self-defense by the Palestinian people, and to justify actions, both selective and large-scale, against the Palestinian population.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/297:1	First, it is important to take into account two equally legitimate desires: on the one hand, the demand of minorities to live in security, to have equal opportunities for economic development and equal access to social services and education, and to exercise the right of return; on the other hand, the desire of the majority of the population to exercise their right to self-determination.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/59:1	Few Iraqi families have been spared the direct and indirect consequences of violence and human rights violations. It is natural that many of them feel deeply that they are victims.	0
1999/s/pv_3969/43:1	The Security Council notes with deep concern the humanitarian consequences of the conflict on the people of Angola.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/82:3	This Council must not allow that, by considering the response to terrorism rather than terrorism itself, that strategy to be rewarded. Terrorism must be rejected, not appeased.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/51:2	In this regard, the Council condemns in the strongest terms the threats and intimidation to which UNMIS elements are continually subjected.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/332:1	At the outset, I would like to reiterate that the European Union is deeply concerned about the situation in Somalia and the regional repercussions of its conflict.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/250:1	In terms of implementation challenges, we believe that sustainable development cannot be achieved without institutions based on good governance and the necessary resources, which will only be available when security and stability prevail.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:1	One of the key issues in post-conflict countries is security sector reform.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/214:5	They do not recognize the illegal and unilateral attempt of secession by the Albanian citizens of Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/340:2	However, concern remains for the 2.3 million people who continue to be in a crisis situation.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/130:1	However, we are concerned about recent developments that reveal increased tensions between local community members and ISAF contingents.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/225:2	However, the situation is still worrying, as the long borders that separate us are difficult to control.	3
2005/s/pv_5243/46:1	I wish to draw the attention of members to document S/2005/436, which contains the text of a letter dated 26 July 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/48:2	The exercise went well, with no major security incidents or logistical challenges that could not be overcome.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/62:1	The main Palestinian factions in Lebanon have expressed concern over the incidents and have disassociated themselves from Fatah al-Islam.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/256:4	The Council must demand an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from Gaza.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/86:2	The limited capacity in the region to trace financial flows is another major challenge, especially given the risk that illicit profits could exacerbate corruption.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/75:4	However, let us be frank with each other: there is no outstanding issue in Kosovo that does not have to do with status, either directly or indirectly.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/91:2	By contemplating initiatives that, in effect, reward this strategy, the Council would only embolden the extremists and undermine the letter and spirit of the roadmap.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/63:2	There can be no doubt that we have underestimated the humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan, and Mr. John Holmes will address the subject in more detail.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/56:4	He has refused to arrest Ali Kushayb and Ahmad Harun.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/54:3	In those difficult days and weeks, the political leaders and citizens of Kosovo faced a very unusual situation with maturity and without any disorder or instability.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/290:1	In addition, we have better defined our initiatives to be even more effective in Afghanistan and specifically in Kandahar province.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/129:3	At the United Nations Security Council, three cases, in particular, are calling for our attention today.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/88:6	The one-state solution might satisfy several fundamental Palestinian desires but it does not meet Israel's essential requirement of retaining its self-determination and sovereignty.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/102:1	This situation persists even when the Libyan authorities are unable to fully control the situation in their country or prevent weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist elements.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/118:2	The Palestinians must stop the public incitement to violence and do everything possible to prevent militants from attacking Israel, thus provoking a reaction.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/60:1	We have reason to be confident that these groups will not succeed in undermining the electoral process at the national level.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/71:2	I was in Afghanistan for four days at the end of June to assess the humanitarian situation, due to growing concerns about the seriousness of humanitarian and civilian protection issues.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/56:1	Palestinians feel the struggle as a daily battle of resistance for their identity and against the erosion of the likelihood of a future as a people.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/127:1	The situation on the ground is also worrying from a humanitarian point of view. The Secretary-General confirms that Iraq is experiencing a huge crisis and says that the situation continues to deteriorate.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/66:6	Although basic training for the Police Reserve Unit was completed on August 23, it is estimated that at least another three months of intensive training and supervision will be required for the duration of its service.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/72:1	At the same time, Germany and the European Union have previously repeatedly condemned the terrorist atrocities that have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/87:3	Effective and sustainable democratic governance is an objective that must be pursued with the utmost determination and even a sense of urgency anywhere, and Haiti is no exception.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/73:4	Undoubtedly, the structure and development of public administration still present important needs in Timor-Leste that need to be considered.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/273:3	That makes the irresponsible and threatening rhetoric of the Iranian leadership all the more alarming.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/53:4	It must maintain its independence and objectivity to instill confidence in the electoral process.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/61:1	Israel is obligated under international law and as the occupying Power to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, as well as to safeguard civilian property.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/63:2	To improve the situation, it is necessary to enforce the law -- especially the law on the elimination of violence against women -- which criminalizes and penalizes practices that are violent and result in harm to women and girls.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/65:1	Last Sunday, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of the establishment of Hamas, Hamas leader Haniyeh made President Abbas' tenure in office conditional on the resolution of the internal division.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/337:1	In discussing the development challenges facing Afghanistan, recent events highlight a bleak picture of the security situation.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/224:4	In this context, the European Union reminds Israel of its obligation to ensure full and safe access to humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).	3
2003/s/pv_4770/183:1	Although a senior PISG official in Kosovo and Metohija recently tried to explain the failure with citations of high unemployment rates, the facts point in another direction.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/312:2	Therefore, another decisive challenge in the near future will be to create a sustainable economy promoted by a culture of democratic and transparent governance, which creates jobs and helps to fulfill the basic social functions of the State.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/426:1	We consider Armenia's position to be a clear challenge to the conflict resolution process and a serious threat to regional and international peace and security.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/191:1	In the view of the Togolese delegation, all these problems require prompt action to prevent the Sahel region from plunging into widespread insecurity, which would be highly detrimental to its development.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/111:1	The other crucial elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by improving the efficiency, fairness and overall functioning of the judicial system, and improving law enforcement institutions to curb organized crime and ethnic violence and bring all criminals to justice.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/98:2	This calls for a clear position, especially, in all honesty, on the part of the United States of America.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/108:2	We are facing these problems in a democratic and effective manner.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/265:3	It is obvious that the continued assistance of the international community will be needed and that, as the Secretary General points out in his report,	0
2011/s/pv_6548/50:1	At the same time, President Al-Bashir is threatening the international community with retaliation and even more crimes.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/117:1	In the current extremely difficult situation, we urge both Israelis and Palestinians to prevent the conflict from escalating and to start fulfilling their obligations under the roadmap to revive the prospects for peace.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/188:8	We now know better the depth of challenges we only imagined then.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/52:2	If these issues are resolved in favor of the prosecution, the accused persons will be found guilty of the charges against them.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/115:2	He added that it can undermine the peace, security and stability of the state.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/212:2	Despite these challenges, we cannot fail to recognize that approximately 50% of the Afghan population lives in areas where responsibility for security has been transferred to Afghan security forces.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/211:1	The humanitarian consequences of the continuing violence in Iraq are of great concern to my delegation.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/145:2	Minorities, especially the Serb minority, have a fundamental obligation to participate fully in the search for solutions, taking every opportunity to participate in Kosovo's institutions.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/229:3	It is high time for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most basic rights of the Palestinian people and to help end the vicious cycle of violence caused by Israel's persistent and continued illegal occupation of Palestinian territories.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/326:1	Brazil is also convinced that in order to achieve a stable Somalia, it is necessary to adopt a comprehensive strategy that combines security and development.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/110:2	All this requires an extremely determined fight against entrenched non-state actors, whose existence represents a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of the sovereignty of the Afghan state.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/333:7	Mr. Chairman: We are disappointed that, despite your efforts and the efforts of many others, the Council was unable to condemn this heinous terrorist attack.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/174:4	However, despite these advances, some challenges to the Government's authority and effective control over the national territory still persist.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/408:3	It is also undisputed that, as the occupying Power, Armenia bears direct responsibility for the commission of these crimes.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/295:1	In order to achieve more concrete progress, the international community must act in a more concerted and decisive manner to establish the basic framework.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/64:1	Another current challenge is the political stalemate in the Transitional Federal Parliament.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/171:2	In this context, we remain concerned about Timor-Leste's most vulnerable citizens: the poor and the displaced.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/84:4	It is part of a mantra constantly repeated before this Council, which, however repeated, proves to be true, that ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights and fails to recognize the enormous difficulties Israeli forces face in trying to protect their citizens and minimize harm to Palestinian lives when the terrorists they face show as little concern for Palestinian lives as for those of Israelis.	3
2007/s/pv_5788/68:3	We note the security concerns that Israel claims compel it to continue these flights, particularly the alleged violations of the arms embargo established under resolution 1701 (2006).	3
2008/s/pv_6049/229:4	Today I will emphasize only the following four aspects.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/74:5	Lack of land and employment and insecurity prevent many returnees from settling in their home communities.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/154:2	The Government of Germany strongly condemns these acts of violence.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/404:1	Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): First of all, I apologize for asking for the floor once again. We believe that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to pass over in silence the remarks made by the representative of Armenia and his attempt to confuse the Council.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/239:1	The continued hardship and suffering of the Palestinian people continues to be a tragic representation of the consequences of not implementing resolutions and not enforcing Security Council decisions.	3
2008/s/pv_5919/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 6:10 p.m.	0
2007/s/pv_5788/54:2	This month Prime Minister Fayyad distributed a summary of the Palestinian reform and development plan for 2008-2010.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/112:2	This unpleasant political incident was strongly condemned in a press release issued immediately after the incident by the Office of President Ernest Bai Koroma and in numerous press releases issued subsequently by other political interest groups, including the APC and PMDC parties, the Independent Media Commission, the Commission for the Registration of Political Parties and the Campaign for Good Governance.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/152:4	We could go on mentioning widespread poverty, natural resource management problems, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, to which must be added thousands of ex-combatants waiting to be reintegrated, weak and unreformed security sectors, massive human rights violations and many other threats that could instigate a new conflict.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/89:2	In this sense, we believe that destructive measures aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be categorically condemned.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/91:1	While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has blamed the other for provoking the incident.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/161:3	We also wish to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents could lead to a situation of instability in the region that would hinder a peaceful solution to the situation in Kosovo, acceptable to the parties.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/75:3	Israel must also refrain from taking unilateral actions in Jerusalem that disrupt the status quo or undermine trust.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/205:2	Organized crime, deeply rooted in political and social life, together with extremism, jeopardize the very foundations of the principles and values we are trying to instill in the new institutions that have been formed there and render our efforts may prove futile.	3
2010/s/pv_6259/58:5	As a result, the boundaries of security threats in many countries within and outside Africa, including members of this Council, have been overstepped, exposing their vulnerabilities.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/59:1	In addition to humanitarian difficulties, the situation raises security concerns.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/201:2	As we have always stressed, this position does not imply any kind of value judgment on the merits of the issue; it is a resolute invitation to give justice and the political process a chance.	0
2004/s/pv_4952/90:4	However, the task is achievable, provided that we set principled but realistic objectives and move towards them with deliberate action, as long as we are not alone in taking those actions.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/202:1	In order to make the best use of the time available to us and to allow as many delegations as possible to take the floor, I will not invite speakers one by one to take their seats at the table or to reoccupy the seat reserved for them at the side of the room.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/135:3	Failure to comply with its Charter obligations should have consequences for any Member State, and Sudan should be no exception.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/105:2	As I have stressed on many occasions, the lasting security and stability of any country, including Timor-Leste, can only be achieved through corresponding socio-economic development.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/224:2	We believe that Somalia faces a challenge comparable to that of a marathon runner, as the drafting of the constitution must be completed by April 20, which must then be adopted on May 22.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/213:3	The impunity of these high-ranking officials is unacceptable and prevents post-conflict communities from recovering in a sustainable manner.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/282:1	The Afghan authorities and the international community must make it clear that such behavior is unacceptable.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/187:5	To date, Pristina has rejected any such initiative.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/108:3	In this regard, the measures taken to address the serious problems in the prison system are encouraging, despite the serious problems that remain.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/69:2	Although the President acted in accordance with his constitutional prerogatives, I expressed concern that the pardon granted on December 25, 2009 could exacerbate perceptions of impunity.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/72:1	The Arab Spring confirms history's warning that when governments respond with an iron fist to the irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands and invincible hopes of their citizens, they are ultimately doomed to failure.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/52:2	The progress made - and there is no doubt that there has been progress - must be seen in the context of the challenges Kosovo has faced.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/250:3	First, they have created a permanent humanitarian emergency situation which, in turn, threatens the peace and stability of Haiti.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/259:7	Building an effective Somali judicial capacity will also enable Somalis to combat the scourge of terrorism and piracy.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/308:2	It is clear that our collective efforts require considerable resources and greater integration, a fact that is reflected in the results of the conferences held in Bucharest and Paris.	0
2006/s/pv_5465/54:1	"For this reason Greece has insisted on the need to clarify, in the sixth preambular paragraph, in which the Council urges ""progress towards the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement"", that it should be reiterated that such negotiations have to take place between the two communities."	3
2010/s/pv_6259/100:1	In that regard, we want to go further and say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to empower the Somali security forces to control the most violent insurgents and to enable the government to expand its areas of authority as much as possible if peace negotiations fail.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/276:2	In his report, the Secretary General notes that some progress has been made in most of these areas, except for the key issue of local government reform and, in particular, decentralization, where progress is comparatively insufficient.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/137:3	The Court's intervention is called upon to be the catalyst for decisive national and international action to respond to the challenges of justice in conflict situations.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/53:1	Some concerns have been expressed about the fairness of the census, most recently by several presidential candidates.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/344:4	To continue in this fight, the international community needs to make a greater contribution and pay more attention to this important aspect of the fight against terrorism.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/109:2	Somalia's long-term security and stability will require a reliable and effective justice system.	0
2002/s/pv_4582/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 13:00 hours.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/178:8	It is a difficult transition, which requires patience and persistence.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/189:2	My delegation strongly condemns these acts of violence and expresses its condolences to the family of the deceased pediatrician.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/116:2	"In return, the Belgrade authorities should end the obstructionist tactic that prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo's public institutions. The ""empty chair policy"" carries a great risk, the risk that Kosovo's history will be written without Kosovo Serbs."	3
2011/s/pv_6618/140:2	The Haitian National Police will need to be adequately resourced to carry out its constitutional law enforcement functions.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/102:2	At the same time, I can understand the need for the international community to direct its attention and resources to other trouble spots around the world.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/101:1	We are particularly concerned about the uncontrolled proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond as a result of the conflict.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/158:3	This would truly demonstrate that the United Nations counter-terrorism efforts are global in nature and that Member States are united.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/105:4	This is a complex challenge for Sahelian countries and regional organizations.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/76:2	We call on Israel to take further steps to remove settler outposts in accordance with the roadmap and address the growing threat of settler extremism.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/161:2	Indeed, a stronger United Nations presence is vital, but for the added value of our Organization to be fully exploited, the necessary means will have to be made available, both in terms of personnel and security, as Mr. Eide reminded us a few minutes ago.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/77:1	Regarding the military aspects of security sector reform, the government has made it clear that it wishes to rely heavily on bilateral aid to increase the military's capabilities.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/286:4	In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the lack of progress in terms of freedom of movement for minorities, sustainable returns and meaningful representation of minorities in government structures and in the public sector in general.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/184:1	My Government is grateful for the many expressions of condemnation and outrage that this atrocity has provoked. We are especially grateful for the Security Council's swift reaction to this gruesome crime.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/238:4	Indeed, because there is a history of foreign interference in the region, such recommendations will not only be suspect in the eyes of various segments of society, but may also have the potential to exacerbate the problem.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/136:1	Above all, we were most concerned about the insistence of the authorities in Pristina to somehow implement the so-called strategy for the northern part of Kosovo, in flagrant contravention of resolution 1244 (1999), which is the main international legal platform for resolving the Kosovo issue.	3
2005/s/pv_5336/44:1	Members of the Council have before them document S/2005/745, which contains the text of a letter dated 7 December 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the report of the Panel of Experts on Liberia.	0
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/55:1	In particular, we would like to express our deep concern about the stagnation of socioeconomic development levels in Haiti and its food security.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/214:3	However, it should be noted that without a strong justice and security sector, the country's flourishing peace and stability could be threatened.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/166:1	The international community has clearly stated its strong condemnation of these acts through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Group of Friends of Syria, which has a wide and abundant participation.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/324:4	The five or six incidents in the border areas, at least those reported, have occurred in Nangarhar and Zabul, near the border with Pakistan.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/299:6	This is a matter of the utmost urgency, as Kenya can no longer bear the burden of this situation.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/92:2	It is clear that the Executive Directorate must not slacken its efforts to achieve these objectives.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/260:4	The threat to security and stability in Afghanistan posed by terrorists, criminals and those involved in the illicit drug trade is real and must be addressed on an ongoing basis.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/71:9	We hope that by the end of this year the instruments for more effective law enforcement in the field of counter-narcotics will be in place.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/354:4	We condemn all acts of terrorism perpetrated in Afghanistan, especially the most recent one that took place at the Indian Embassy in Kabul, and express our condolences to the governments and peoples of the affected countries, as well as to the families of the victims.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/103:2	The collection of timely, accurate, reliable and objective information on conflict-related sexual violence is critical to tailoring the Council's responses, as well as to enhancing action to prevent sexual violence.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/124:4	The true establishment of the rule of law in the DRC requires the formation of an effective and democratic army, judicial system and police force.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/241:1	The international community should -- including through the auspices of the United Nations -- use diplomatic leverage and facilitate, among other things, technical assistance in areas such as political, security and justice sector reform; the drafting of new constitutions and legal frameworks; and the development of electoral institutions and the conduct of elections.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/154:1	The ongoing instability in the Sahel has implications beyond the countries most directly affected.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/68:5	It calls for adherence to international law and for the parties to fulfill their obligations and the roadmap to achieve the vision of two states living side by side in peace and security.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/227:4	We cannot run the risk that the financial and human effort made so far in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be lost in the face of citizen frustration and, eventually, the crisis and conflict will resurface.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/187:4	The Board would be failing in its duty if it did not use these tools when circumstances so require.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/276:2	In these conditions, where profound inequalities and political, economic and social exclusion converge, a process of transformation of the prevailing order is emerging in search of economic and political changes and alternatives for participation and openness to new spaces and mechanisms of expression that imply, in short, the vindication of fundamental rights.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/241:1	ISAF troops must fully implement their mandate to eradicate threats emanating from Afghanistan.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/165:1	In my delegation's view, in order to prevent further outbreaks of violence and instability in the northern region of Kosovo, it remains essential that the reconciliation process be accompanied by policies aimed at ensuring the socio-economic stability of communities in a non-discriminatory manner.	3
2011/s/pv_6662/49:3	Withholding that level of funding would cripple any government, and a fortiori an authority in occupied territory. If the funds are not immediately released, it will jeopardize the achievements of state-building, including further good governance that would benefit the Palestinian people and the development of security forces defending law and order in the West Bank.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/54:2	As Council members know better than anyone, the Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the greatest diplomatic challenges the world has faced since the mid-20th century. At the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a dispute with competing and contradictory historical narratives, collective aspirations and identities.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/160:1	Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a common concern of all members of the United Nations and of the international community at large.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/116:8	Naturally, this causes growing concern among the population and causes some to question the over-reliance on the military option.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/232:2	However, there is a serious danger that, as a result of this decision, which violates the documents of the Bonn and Berlin conferences, the country will face an explosive situation characterized by a new armed resistance and by the internal division of the power structures.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/265:1	Finding a starting point for discussions on the outstanding challenges facing Middle Eastern societies and finding potential opportunities arising from these problems could be an onerous task.	0
2006/s/pv_5603/251:1	Addressing the causes of economic failure requires ongoing projects based on sound trade and economic principles, especially given the region's strategic location within the African continent and the fact that it has a wealth of natural resources.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/284:7	They have taken all these actions, and then they ask for protection and guarantees and use these arguments to continue to extort more concessions from us.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/57:1	Since the publication of the report, there has been a significant increase in attention devoted to the situation on Liberia's border with Côte d'Ivoire.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/265:1	When assessing that progress, it is important to recognize how far Timor-Leste has come in the few years since independence, but just as important to acknowledge the significant challenges that still need to be addressed.	0
2007/s/pv_5788/58:1	I would also like to point out the active Arab diplomacy in preparation for the conference.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/145:2	The prohibition of illegal cross-border movement is vital in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling.	3
2004/s/pv_4952/69:5	Of course, there are those who are uncomfortable with what they see as an excessive and, indeed, negative concern for ethnic balance.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/59:3	Despite the fact that almost 80% of the Afghan population is directly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods, only a very small amount of money has been allocated to this sector of the economy.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/129:2	Unless addressed by the Government, these problems could pose serious threats to the security and stability of Timor-Leste.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/87:2	However, prevention will only be effective if peacekeeping operations have the necessary resources to carry out their mandate.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/271:4	The Palestinian Authority's ability to build reliable institutions and a security infrastructure capable and willing to fight terrorism and other threats is a key element for the creation of a Palestinian state and a legitimate expectation on the part of Israel.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/287:1	It is clear that definitive progress in these areas will require further concerted efforts on the part of the international community, as well as Belgrade and the Kosovars.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/66:2	Viet Nam is of the view that the diverse nature of violence against women and girls requires a comprehensive approach.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/275:1	The current problems of Afghan communities require a comprehensive solution, not strictly limited to military and security activities, but also encompassing political, economic and developmental activities.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/301:3	In our view, it is important that the Conference clearly underlined the importance of Afghan leadership and, ultimately, ownership of efforts to address the key challenges facing Afghanistan: security, lack of institutional capacity, corruption and narcotics.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/171:5	To prevent a new wave of violence, both sides and the international community must act promptly.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/169:2	In order to restore real stability, a detailed and far-reaching approach is needed, including a comprehensive set of legal, political and international tools.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/208:1	We strongly condemn such practices, which constitute a flagrant violation of international norms and humanitarian law. We therefore urge the international community, the Quartet and all other stakeholders to intervene immediately and decisively to demand that Israel cease such acts, which pose a grave threat to peace and security in the Middle East region. Violence only breeds violence. The region will be trapped in a vicious circle from which it will be difficult to escape.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/246:3	This is particularly true with respect to the political sphere and the security situation.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/265:2	In this regard, we are very concerned about the prevailing security situation in Afghanistan, which has been deteriorating since last year as a result of the subversive activities of the remaining Taliban and Al-Qaida elements, warlord clashes and narcotics trafficking.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/255:3	Somali leaders must work toward a political process that is open to all those willing to reject violent opposition.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/161:1	International terrorism remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/189:4	When UNMIK and KFOR requested data about the Army's presence in the KPC, they received a very typical response from the KPC commander, who said that, given his limited competencies, he could not provide further information.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/55:1	Let me briefly address the specific proposals contained in the revised organizational plan and how these concerns are addressed.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/255:2	It is important for the police to have community outreach and acceptance as the primary law enforcement agency.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/42:2	While this is constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the parties would be expected to present territorial and security proposals within 90 days, are still not taking place.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/151:4	While this is a good starting point, its long-term sustainability will only be achieved if the government deploys complementary efforts to address other socioeconomic problems.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/68:2	We need peace to be able to deal with other equally Dantesque challenges.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/163:1	Economic issues, and in particular investment, are also of deep concern.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/235:1	In this context, Russia is convinced of the importance of developing a comprehensive international counter-narcotics strategy, including the establishment of a security belt along the Afghan borders.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/82:1	Sierra Leone is also experiencing increased investment in the extractive sector.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/69:2	Some of these countries face enormous challenges, and there will be setbacks and progress in the coming years.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/150:3	We urge the Government of Haiti to take strong measures to prevent such violence and to ensure that those responsible for such acts are brought to justice.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/249:1	Subsequently, seven years later, in the 2009 edition, it was further noted that approximately 30% of young people in Arab countries were unemployed, that more than 50% of the population was under 24 years of age, and that 51 million new jobs needed to be created by 2020 to avoid an increase in the unemployment rate.	0
2010/s/pv_6297/58:7	These issues must be addressed within the framework of security sector reform.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/65:1	Once again the Russian Federation urges the Israeli and Palestinian sides to show restraint and a high level of responsibility, and to refuse unilateralism.	3
2009/s/pv_6111/53:1	I cannot overemphasize the risk that the lack of military helicopters poses to the operational effectiveness of the force.	3
2004/s/pv_4952/83:2	Some of our Iraqi interlocutors asked what exactly the term national reconciliation meant and what it required.	0
2009/s/pv_6236/52:4	As outlined in the report, the period under review saw significant progress in the peace process as well as in the preparations for the 2010 elections, although some challenges remain.	0
2009/s/pv_6111/58:1	Beyond MINURCAT's area of responsibility in eastern Chad, other developments are also cause for concern.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/110:6	Likewise, representative democracy requires that citizens have confidence in the governments they elect.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/165:1	In addition, while the overall security situation has remained calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste officially assumed full security responsibility on May 20, smuggling, illegal trade and border crossings, as well as tensions following demonstrations in Dili in July, should be considered a cause for concern.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/126:2	The lack of participation in these institutions impedes progress on specific public administration issues, and does not contribute to improving Kosovo's international image.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/58:1	Fortunately, the choices before the people of Iraq are not black and white, nor are they zero-sum. There is a whole middle range of compromise that can accommodate the essential concerns of all participants in the political process.	0
2006/s/pv_5492/59:1	Notwithstanding our assessment that a full ceasefire is difficult to achieve at this time, I remain of the view that the international community must make clear its position on the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for Israel to make a much greater and more reliable effort to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure while the conditions for such a cessation are established as a matter of urgency.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/271:1	The review of the security situation contained in the Secretary-General's special report (S/2008/434) suggests that, despite the tireless efforts of the Afghan people and the international community, serious challenges to peace and stabilization in Afghanistan remain.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/188:3	On March 4, he urged the issuance of arrest warrants for state officials, provoking popular outrage and undermining hopes for peace and stability.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/379:1	Mr. Eide: I don't think I have been asked any questions, but I would like to make a few remarks.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/154:1	We are also concerned about the resurgence of cholera cases, although the mortality rate appears to be slowly declining.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/128:6	Tent camps have been closed and internally displaced persons are returning to normal life, although some problems remain that require a rapid response.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/121:2	Measures to overcome these deficiencies must address both immediate needs and structural deficits.	0
2011/s/pv_6566/71:1	The President (spoke in French): I now give the floor to Ambassador Jose Filipe Moraes Cabral of Portugal, in his capacity as Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/54:3	However, in 2007, after the issuance of the arrest warrants against Harun and Kushayb, President Al-Bashir publicly rejected their implementation, challenged the authority of the Security Council and declared that Harun had done what he had been ordered to do.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/110:2	The current political situation in Kosovo reflects realities that run counter to these basic premises; we hope that this is only part of the learning process of democratic stabilization.	0
1999/s/pv_3969/39:3	In this context, it reaffirms that the root cause of the crisis in Angola is UNITA's refusal to comply with the basic provisions of the Lusaka Protocol and reiterates its demand that UNITA abide by its obligations to demilitarize and allow the extension of state administration to the territories it controls.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/115:1	The President emphatically described the unfortunate incident as unpleasant and unacceptable, as it foreshadows possible violence during the upcoming 2012 elections.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/191:3	As the presidential elections approach, there is an even greater need and urgency to improve the security situation.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/56:4	The Movement for Democratic Change candidate has little or no access to the Zimbabwean media; he is prohibited from campaigning freely; and there are reports that the State has confiscated campaign buses and vehicles, allegedly because they were not properly registered.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/149:1	Bosnia and Herzegovina is concerned about the current political impasse in establishing a new government and defining a clear constitutional reform process.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/105:4	We have to admit that we are very concerned about the current situation in Afghanistan.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/127:3	The United Nations zero tolerance policy for such actions should be emphasized, and there should be no impunity for those guilty of such crimes.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/103:1	We have approached the Council on several occasions to urge Israel to cease its military attacks, ensure the protection of the civilian population and end the illegal punitive measures that are causing a deliberate human catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/255:1	Cuba once again appears before the Security Council to denounce and condemn in the strongest terms the complicity and absolute responsibility of the United States Government in the release of this individual.	3
2008/s/pv_5919/62:1	Africans have clearly expressed their concerns regarding the situation in Zimbabwe.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/171:2	Again, these challenges include national reconciliation, a power-sharing agreement and the equitable distribution of natural resources, specifically oil revenues.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/100:2	Moreover, the negative effects are also evident outside its borders and not only on the African continent.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/222:1	The European Union is deeply concerned by the cycle of fierce violence currently taking place in Israel and the occupied territories.	3
2011/s/pv_6688/59:3	President Al-Bashir retaliated diplomatically against Kenya and threatened it with economic and trade sanctions.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/125:2	During these discussions, the Chinese delegation has always stressed its view that the Darfur issue involves a political process, the deployment of peacekeepers, economic development, humanitarian assistance and justice. It is very complex and requires enormous political wisdom to find a comprehensive solution that ensures the achievement of peace and justice.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/195:4	While a leader can be overthrown in a few months, the establishment of a democratic society requires more time and greater sacrifices.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/72:4	Otherwise, we may witness more violent ruptures when the people demand rights that no amount of coercion will convince them to abandon.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/307:4	In this context, we consider it important to draw the attention of the Security Council to the serious threats posed by radical and extremist religious organizations such as Hizb ut-Tahir, and urge the Council to impose the strongest possible sanctions against terrorist organizations.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/56:1	I must report, with great concern, an escalation in criminal acts and attacks against UN and humanitarian personnel.	3
2007/s/pv_5683/68:2	In addition, Israel has regularly continued air violations of the Blue Line, in direct violation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/87:1	The Government of Brazil is closely following the efforts of the Government of Haiti to prepare for institutional reforms.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/134:2	In this regard, we have taken note of the statements issued by the main Kosovar elected representatives, who immediately condemned the crime and called for those responsible to be brought to justice.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/88:1	In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I would like to remind speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/152:2	It is up to the people and leaders of the region to resist demagogic appeals, to forge and build coalitions, to remain confident in their system, even if they lose elections, and to defend the principles and institutions that will ultimately protect them.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/284:2	We believe that Palestine will remain the greatest challenge in the Middle East.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/154:2	These priorities are directly related to the credibility of the Executive Directorate.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/217:2	Consequently, the international community must take whatever measures are necessary to prevent Israel from persisting in the deplorable destructive policy it has undertaken in Gaza, and must stress its rejection of all such Israeli practices, which violate international law and international humanitarian law.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/154:2	Although unpredictable, these changes are proof of an old rule of politics: the inability to introduce reforms provokes revolutions.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/194:5	This issue has never ceased to concern us.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/261:1	While a solution to the 60-year-old Palestinian tragedy would have a profound impact on the situation in the Middle East, peace in the region also requires progress on other axes of the peace process.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/114:3	That is also why I have deliberately omitted to touch on other topics that some would consider mandatory when discussing the Middle East, such as the imperative of overcoming the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the situation in Syria, since we have already addressed these issues at other Council meetings.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10:05 a.m.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/85:1	But we are also against extrajudicial killings and condemn them.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/141:3	We condemn all ethnically motivated acts and crimes perpetrated in Kosovo.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/136:2	However, we do not believe that sovereignty requires the Council to remain silent when governments massacre their own people, threatening regional peace and security in the process.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/149:1	No one in the region is free from the demands for change that we have seen.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/177:1	The security problems in the Sahelo-Saharan region are not new.	0
2006/s/pv_5466/51:3	Here, too, we perceived reactions that seemed to justify our concerns.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/57:1	As Prosecutor, I will deal with any legal challenges to President Al-Bashir and other suspects in court.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/202:2	We must avoid giving easy answers and claiming that the Sahel has always faced such challenges, when, in fact, it is well known that the challenges were not of that magnitude before.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/53:2	Due to the upsurge in violence, the Karni border crossing was closed between May 15 and 20 and has been opened only sporadically since then.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/282:1	The nature of the terrorist threat differs from State to State, region to region, as do the capabilities and needs of States in the fight against terrorism.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/266:1	The international guarantors of security in Timor-Leste, the International Stabilization Force (ISF) and UNMIT are no longer facing the same difficulties as they did two or three years ago.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/419:3	Azerbaijan's refusal to engage in direct negotiations with the elected representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the main impediments to the settlement of the conflict referred to by the Azerbaijani representative.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/242:2	Undoubtedly, improving the security situation is the biggest challenge facing the country. It will determine the future course of political, economic and social development in Iraq.	0
2007/s/pv_5683/64:1	The Secretary-General and his Special Coordinator for Lebanon have issued statements strongly condemning the criminal actions of Fatah al-Islam as attacks against Lebanon's stability and sovereignty.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/182:6	The United States urges the United Nations and the Haitian National Police to redouble vetting efforts.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/143:1	When the situation in Haiti is addressed within the United Nations framework, the focus is almost always on so-called security issues, and urgent attention to the serious structural, economic and social problems afflicting the country is minimized for all practical purposes.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/159:1	On the humanitarian situation, we are concerned that, according to information from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 20 million people in the Sahel region are in need of humanitarian assistance, particularly in Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/153:2	The first relates to the fight against impunity.	0
2009/s/pv_6236/74:1	Secondly, there are fears regarding the deterioration of trust between the opposition and the ruling party.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/196:3	From this point of view, the restoration of peace, security and national unity are the first challenges to be faced.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/129:1	We are also concerned about the very high unemployment rate and widespread poverty in the country.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/147:3	A comprehensive approach, entirely under Afghan ownership, is essential to meet this challenge.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/125:1	The first observation concerns the situation on the ground, which is clearly worrisome.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/317:1	To meet these standards, more powers and responsibilities must be transferred to local authorities and privatization must be accelerated.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/55:3	After initial hesitation, the party chose to resolve this challenge in accordance with the law and in accordance with its own party constitution by holding new elections for party delegates.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/54:4	We felt that this process should be conducted in a way that allows all Afghans equally to participate in the elections, while taking into account the security challenges we face.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/321:2	Aspects related to the definition of the roles and responsibilities of the PNTL and the Falintil-Forças de Defesa de Timor-Leste have also been raised.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/288:1	Third, the humanitarian situation in Somalia continues to be of concern.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/154:3	Sufficient and timely resources are required to maintain processes that are destined to be lengthy and complex.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/60:2	However, we are concerned that the violence may result in some of the population not making it to the polling stations in the south and elsewhere.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/184:3	The Rome Statute, adopted earlier that same year, constituted an immense breakthrough by incorporating, for the first time and explicitly in an international legal framework, acts of sexual violence such as rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution and forced pregnancy. It did so in such a way that prosecution in such cases has become feasible.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/283:1	Cholera remains a real threat.	0
2008/s/pv_5919/47:2	Since the beginning of the political stalemate, following the March 29 elections, the Secretary General has expressed concern about the process and politically motivated violence.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/79:4	However, in other areas, progress has fallen short of expectations, and many problems persist.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/108:2	Significant progress has also been made in the areas of public administration and crime suppression.	0
2002/s/pv_4583/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 1:05 p.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/327:4	I think our friends in the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and our allies are well aware of what those needs are.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/71:3	My Government considers that they are not only contrary to international law, but also undermine the concept of the rule of law, a fundamental element in the fight against terrorism.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/143:2	Peace, security and stability in that nation require, first and foremost, the elimination of poverty and underdevelopment.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/261:2	However, much more remains to be done, particularly in the areas of security, law enforcement, government capacity, development, the private sector and the personal safety of all Afghan citizens.	0
2011/s/pv_6688/107:1	We challenge anyone who says that there is an outbreak of violence or battle anywhere in Sudan at this time.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/75:3	Romania stresses once again that any terrorist act is unacceptable and must be condemned.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/183:1	French authorities are extremely concerned about the ongoing deterioration of the situation in the northern Gaza Strip over the past week.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/276:1	When I had the honor of addressing this issue before the Council in February (see S/PV.5130), I noted that the protection of minority communities, the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, freedom of movement and decentralization were areas that required particular attention because of their direct link to our common goal of a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/157:3	The Conference also reminded us of the difficult challenges we face.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/86:3	This course of action is of great concern to us, as it runs the serious risk of undermining the integrity of United Nations operations.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/172:2	That is why we condemn terrorism.	3
2010/s/pv_6444/52:1	The Security Council remains seriously concerned about the security situation in the Central African Republic.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/279:3	This is unacceptable and must be forcefully rejected, especially by the Security Council, using the mechanisms at its disposal.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/324:1	The humanitarian situation in Somalia continues to be of great concern.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 3:25 p.m.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/80:1	It is necessary for everyone to reject the extremist voices who prefer things to continue as before and who believe that it is impossible for Serbs and Albanians to normalize their relations by reaching a historic compromise.	3
2010/s/pv_6259/53:2	The crisis, which has become more challenging than ever, can no longer be ignored.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/248:2	The first edition, published in 2002, noted that the lack of freedom in the Arab world undermined human development and was one of the most painful manifestations of lagging political development.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/65:1	The situation along the Lebanese-Syrian border also remains a cause for concern.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/120:2	However, make no mistake: this is a challenge for all of Kosovo, not just for a minority.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/103:3	Some allegations in the press are based on mere speculation, and it is important that the investigation is conducted with the calmness that this kind of situation demands.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/184:1	Somalis should take responsibility for ensuring their own security and establish their own justice system in order to deal with threats to their security.	0
2002/s/pv_4583/49:1	The Security Council also expresses its concern over the growing tensions in the Ituri region and calls on all parties to exercise restraint.	3
2011/s/pv_6579/65:4	The status of the Blue Nile continues to be of concern to us.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/341:4	Therefore, the United Nations bodies engaged in the fight against terrorism should address these cracks more seriously and with more dedication.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/419:2	In fact, Azerbaijan itself violates these resolutions, which urge the parties concerned to engage in negotiations within the framework of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as through various contacts between them.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/51:2	I expressed the deep concern of this Council and the Secretary-General over the recent increase in tensions between the North and the South, as well as the continued lack of progress on Abyei and other post-CPA issues.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/111:1	The Russian Federation expresses its deep regret and concern over the information regarding the persistence of violence in Darfur.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/58:4	I am very concerned about the latest escalation between Gaza and Israel.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/281:4	It is clear that these circumstances represent the greatest obstacle to stability and progress in Afghanistan and, if allowed to continue, threaten to undo the progress made over the course of nearly three years.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/127:1	Promoting security and stability remains a key issue.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/55:2	However, the process has also highlighted how significant challenges remain in Liberia's security sector, especially in terms of logistics, communications and mobility capabilities of the police and immigration service.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/64:1	Pakistan is extremely concerned about the report's conclusion that the humanitarian and economic challenges facing the Sahel region have been exacerbated as an aftermath of the Libyan crisis.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/151:2	In particular, we condemn any attempt to force UNMIK into a kind of joint governance, as well as any interference in the powers reserved to the Special Representative.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/298:4	We know that civil society organizations have expressed serious concerns in this regard.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/61:2	It is clear that all law enforcement institutions face serious challenges.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/65:1	Political pressures on UNMIK have increased significantly, and attempts have been made to challenge the role conferred on it by resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/253:5	Today we have no doubt that the real intention was to prevent the details of his vandalism from being made public while acting under the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency.	3
2009/s/pv_6236/97:1	The Government also shares a number of concerns expressed in the report which relate, inter alia, to human rights and the situation of children and women.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/176:3	We are seriously concerned about this decree, which may have far-reaching consequences.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/237:4	However, we believe that an abrupt withdrawal would be counterproductive and would create an unprecedented vacuum, especially in view of the fact that the conditions are not conducive to the long-awaited large-scale investment and sustainable development.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/333:1	At the outset, I wish to express our deep concern regarding the security situation in the country.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/105:1	I must say that the topic you have set for our discussion today, while exciting, is a great challenge.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/185:3	As indicated in the Secretary-General's report (S/2004/634), this is a truly daunting challenge.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/162:1	However, my delegation regrets that security conditions continue to be of concern.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/67:3	I urge Hamas to respond positively to these calls.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/114:2	He strongly reiterated his personal condemnation of the incident, and said that it conveyed a very undesirable and damaging message ahead of the 2012 elections, which could contradict and spoil the national achievements related to changing the image of the country and establishing and consolidating peace, which was so painstakingly achieved with the help of our development partners and the international community.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/93:1	Unfortunately, the current Palestinian leadership has shown that it is as incapable of being a peace partner as it is of offering its people reform and democratic government.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/163:1	First, security concerns remain paramount.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/101:6	It is clear that the situation in Darfur does not meet the necessary conditions for the application of these provisions.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/86:1	First, although Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West Africa Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere is impeding data sharing and early warning.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/125:6	France strongly condemns this attack and urges all parties to exercise the utmost restraint.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/53:5	The political debate is likely to intensify, given that several election-related appeals have already been filed with the courts.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/120:1	The report confirms a worrying picture regarding the situation in the Sahel region and the related issues of security, economy and humanitarian conditions.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/335:1	Secondly, Mr. Cŏvić expressed concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority -- the Kosovo Serbs -- are at risk of being outvoted I would say that I think the most important aspect of democracy is really the possibility to participate, to exercise the rights of a democracy and to vote.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/308:1	We have expressed our serious concern about the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/44:3	In Egypt, we continue to urge a peaceful and immediate transfer of power to a civilian government.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/144:3	The situation of minorities continues to be of concern, especially in terms of freedom of movement and access to justice.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/219:1	Once again, we condemn the killing of civilians, whether Palestinian or Israeli.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/134:1	There is another challenge that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority: the creation of a local and regional administration in the regions liberated from Al-Shabaab.	3
2005/s/pv_5243/35:1	Letter dated 26 July 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council (S/2005/436)	0
2010/s/pv_6353/207:2	We urge all parties to exercise restraint and avoid actions or statements that may instigate further violence.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/181:4	The United States urges the Haitian authorities to fulfill their commitment to fill the six Supreme Court vacancies by October 3, 2011.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/120:1	We are concerned that the success of the presidential elections is at risk of fading due to the lack of progress in the formation of the government.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/139:2	The challenges facing the country require Haitian leaders to forge a common bond.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/65:1	However, the potential remains for a total breakdown of law and order, as well as a collapse of the fragile economy and a disintegration of autonomous institutions.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/128:4	The negative effects of the situation in Libya will continue to grow, posing a sustained threat to peace and stability in the region. China expresses its deep concern in this regard.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/73:1	It remains of great concern to me that Liberians' efforts to rebuild their court system will take a long time, so the system itself is likely to remain fragile and easy to penetrate in the short term.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/78:6	In 1993, that vision was blurry, to say the least. At that time it was impossible to define the ultimate objectives that would come close to addressing the concerns of both peoples.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/255:1	We have taken note of the caution of the Secretary General and the technical assessment mission regarding security sector reform, and especially with respect to the PNTL.	3
2011/s/pv_6688/74:2	Such false accusations contradict reason and the basic rules of a professional attitude. I am confident that the Board will dismiss them.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/96:1	The interest in the implementation of the joint communiqué of April 2, 2009, referred to in the report, is noteworthy.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/62:2	This has led to great tensions with local communities, as well as threats against MONUC by some former CNDP military commanders now integrated into the FARDC.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/140:2	We consider it unacceptable to deviate from this principle as the fragile situation of the province could plunge into general destabilization.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/61:2	Voices continue to be raised by Haitian political leaders and civil society actors calling for a national consensus to move forward in key areas such as the national budget, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and constitutional reform.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/216:1	The Government of Jordan stresses the need for the Government of Israel to immediately and completely halt its acts of violence and destruction in the Gaza Strip, as well as throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory; to cease its policy of deliberate destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and homes; and to immediately cease its extrajudicial killings and imposition of collective punishment and other practices against the Palestinian people.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/153:5	However, we are still concerned about the overemphasis on visits to developing countries.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/320:2	As UNAMA we would be irresponsible if we did not urge the international community, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan and the international forces to put an end to this situation, especially on the southern border.	3
2006/s/pv_5492/55:3	While Hezbollah's actions are deplorable and, as I have said, Israel has the right of self-defense, the excessive use of force must be condemned.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/108:1	Pakistan's new democratic government has inherited enormous political, economic and security problems.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/234:4	Sustained developments in that direction would jeopardize efforts to restore and rebuild the country and, in the long term, threaten peace and stability in the entire region.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/171:5	We have fenced off a 25-kilometer stretch of the border and installed floodlights and video cameras at the border crossings.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/45:2	As Council members are aware, migration from North to South has begun and, for the first time, will represent the crossing of an international border.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/67:4	Questioning the fundamental cornerstones of Palestinian legitimacy and national aspirations cannot be in the interest of the Palestinian people.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/61:1	The prevailing situation in Syria is of deep and growing concern to the United Nations.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/173:2	We are particularly concerned about the lack of preparation of mid-level public officials and the great deficiencies that still persist in the judicial area.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/98:1	While outside the mandate of UNMISET, the recent decision of an Indonesian Court of Appeals overturning four convictions by the Indonesian Special Court for Human Rights directly affects the broader issue of adjudicating responsibility.	3
2009/s/pv_6236/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10:55 a.m.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/58:1	I am particularly concerned about the unstable present that could deteriorate further if the political situation does not change and if the socio-economic situation continues to remain unaddressed.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/285:3	The United States must desist from this deliberate disregard, a practice it has maintained for almost seven years and which has led to the deterioration of the situation in the region.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/48:5	However, they were not significant enough to undermine the process. Simple logistics will make it difficult to manage to vote twice on election day.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/198:3	We are also concerned about the situation faced by those who are currently collaborating in the reconstruction of the country.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/112:2	We are very concerned about the stubborn refusal of the leaders of groups such as JEM and SLM to participate in the talks.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/46:2	The Council condemns any unilateral action aimed at creating situations on the ground that prejudice the results of the negotiations.	3
2011/s/pv_6544/41:3	The Council stresses that all those responsible for violations of international law, including humanitarian and human rights law, as well as those who ordered such acts, must be held accountable.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/114:4	Statements such as Palestinians do not love their children or that Palestinians send their children to their deaths because they hate Israel are racially charged words that reflect a kind of attitude that should be rejected out of hand, which I am now trying to do.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/176:4	Blaming others, looking for scapegoats to hold responsible for failures in Afghanistan and asking those who are already doing more than they should to do even more is unfair and unacceptable and will ultimately be counterproductive.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/108:2	We cannot send the message that terrorists will be immune and be satisfied with routine convictions.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/91:4	Many achievements have been made but many challenges remain.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/124:5	The recent publication by the Ulema Council of a religious decree condemning drug trafficking and related activities may be instrumental in discouraging opium poppy cultivation.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/286:3	We therefore encourage the members of the Council and the Group of Friends to look favorably upon these recommendations of the Secretary General.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/113:4	It seems that the population not only aspires but demands that more pluralistic and representative governments generate tangible benefits for citizens.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/122:1	Timor-Leste continues to face significant challenges related to poverty reduction and the creation of employment opportunities, particularly for young people.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/152:3	In light of recent experiences, it is also clear that the Court will continue to face some serious problems.	0
2009/s/pv_6236/59:1	Another election-related challenge is the significant number of potential voters who cannot afford the administrative costs involved in obtaining a national ID card.	0
2011/s/pv_6544/47:2	The Council demands that the Government of Sudan immediately withdraw from the Abyei area.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/126:1	Security sector reform remains one of the main challenges to long-term peace and stability.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/174:1	Uganda believes that ending impunity is the only deterrent against the crimes of greatest concern to the international community.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/153:3	We are deeply concerned that unless both sides demonstrate a strong will to end terrorism and violence, the peace process will not succeed.	3
2008/s/pv_6024/135:1	We note that, in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/269:1	Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continuing illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/201:3	We were therefore frustrated that the Secretary General's report recommended only a partial reduction of reinforcement troops.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/215:3	However, what Afghanistan has accomplished is now significantly undermined by serious challenges to its security and stability.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/111:1	While air piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a serious problem, we urge the international community not to forget that the solution must be found on land, not at sea. A comprehensive resolution to the Somali conflict must address all the root causes of piracy and other problems, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic waste.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/148:1	The second aspect I would like to address today is our ongoing concern for the welfare of innocent people in Gaza and in the towns and cities of southern Israel.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/364:5	Finally, there is an urgent need for Afghans to take the lead in the fight against narcotics.	3
2006/s/pv_5492/53:3	I also condemn the reckless disregard shown by Hezbollah for the wishes of the elected Government of Lebanon and for the interests of the Lebanese people and the region at large.	3
2007/s/pv_5798/43:1	"""The Security Council strongly condemns the terrorist attacks that occurred in Algiers on 11 December 2007 in the vicinity of the Supreme Court and the United Nations offices, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries, and expresses its deep sorrow and condolences to the victims of this heinous act of terrorism and their families, as well as to the people and the Government of Algeria."	3
2004/s/pv_5049/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 4:05 p.m.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/71:1	I also remember how unpopular it was to talk to Israelis about the 1967 borders, and for a long time it was almost inconceivable to propose the evacuation of Israeli settlements.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/155:1	The Secretary-General's latest report on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) clearly states the importance of disarming Hezbollah and ending arms smuggling along the Lebanese-Syrian borders.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/228:2	Needless to say, there are currently no patterns of sexual violence in Kenya, and none of the reported activities concerning our country occurred during the current reporting period from 2010 to 2011.	0
2002/s/pv_4597/4:1	"""At its 4597th meeting, held in private on 8 August 2002, the Security Council considered the item entitled 'The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo'."	0
2008/s/pv_5930/109:1	I condemned the terrorist attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/260:2	We are concerned about the growing insurgency in some areas of Afghanistan.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/116:2	In fact, more than half of the African issues of interest to the Council and on its agenda concern the countries of the Great Lakes region: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, northern Uganda, the Sudan and the Central African Republic.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/361:1	Today's debate deals with an urgent matter.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/200:3	It is essential that cases of domestic violence and sexual assault be formally prosecuted in accordance with the criminal code.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/188:5	This is perhaps the result of the urgency and also the very limitations of this Council, as an intergovernmental political body of a fundamentally executive nature.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/245:2	It demands that Israel, the occupying Power, abide by all the rules of international law and the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, in addition to the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/133:2	This elementary obligation is breached by some States without them suffering any consequences for their unlawful conduct.	3
2007/s/pv_5683/70:2	I had hoped that the new Special Coordinator would be able to join us today, but the Secretary General sent him urgently to the region.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/180:2	Our country has repeatedly expressed its concern for the civilian population in that area and the importance of MONUC's deployment there to protect them.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/139:1	The incident in North Mitrovica clearly demonstrated that, despite the Security Council mandate on the reconfiguration of UNMIK, EULEX is increasingly moving away from the principle of status neutrality, which is detrimental to the position of the international presence.	3
2001/s/ac_26/2001/28/412:1	152 dinars per capita x 837 workers x 7 months/17 months = 52,387 Kuwaiti dinars.	0
