"As the final communiqué of the London conference stresses, specialized Somali courts would satisfy these needs."	0
The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.	0
"We condemn the disproportionate use of force employed by the Israeli military in densely populated areas that has caused widespread suffering and loss among scores of Palestinian civilians, including children."	1
"""The Security Council stresses that RCD-Goma will be held accountable for any extrajudicial executions, including among members of the civil society or detainees at the detention centres of RCD in Kisangani."	1
"Together, those challenges put political pressure on Governments and have a direct and dangerous impact on the peace, security and stability in the countries concerned."	1
"In that regard, I would like to stress once again that, in contrast to some other well-known situations involving groundless and illegitimate territorial claims, including those under the concocted pretext of care for ethnic minority groups, the right to self-determination and statehood of the people of Palestine has been recognized."	1
"""At its 4364th meeting, held in private on 5 September 2001, the Security Council considered the situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo."	0
The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.	0
The impasse risks raising political tensions and undermines the mood of increased confidence that prevailed following the elections and the inauguration of President Martelly.	1
"For our part, we link the question of legitimacy directly to the holding of the elections, whose preparations are under way in the Joint Election Management Body."	1
"At its 4183rd meeting, held in private on 3 August 2000, the Security Council considered the item entitled ""The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo""."	0
"""The Security Council reiterates its condemnation of all targeted assassinations of Lebanese leaders, particularly since October 2004, and demands an immediate end of the use of intimidation and violence against the representatives of the Lebanese people and institutions."	1
"The Cuban delegation energetically condemns the carrying out of attacks against Palestinian civilians, as well as the general destruction being caused by Israeli occupation forces in the northern Gaza Strip. We also call for an immediate end to those attacks and for the urgent withdrawal of the occupation forces."	1
"Qassam rocket-fire from Gaza continues, even as we speak, to be deliberately directed against the civilian community, targeting and terrorizing innocent civilians as they lie in their beds, sit in their living rooms or take their children to school."	1
"I would also like to reiterate that the four F-FDTL members convicted of manslaughter in the shooting deaths of eight PNTL officers in 2006, one of whom was pardoned and three of whom received sentence reductions, have yet to pay the court-ordered compensation to the victims' widows."	1
"Such positions can be seen as indirect participation in misleading public opinion and disregard for the Syrian Government's position regarding events on its own territory. It is an irresponsible incitement of all sorts of acts of violence, providing international cover for international terrorist acts undertaken by terrorist groups against Syria, its interests and its people."	1
"Let us speak frankly: these accounts from the press, human rights groups and civilians on the ground raise grave concerns about the nature and scale of the conflict."	1
The leaders of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government frequently shirk their obligations under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	1
"Among such concerns, one must be highlighted: the deterioration of the security situation in recent weeks and months."	1
"It is with greater concern that I must report again today that, despite considerable efforts on the part of UNAMID, the security situation in Darfur has not greatly improved."	1
The socio-economic challenges facing Afghanistan are significant.	1
"These cover campaign financing, electoral activities and public order, access to the media and the misuse of government resources for political purposes."	1
"Finally, the broad institutional, cultural, ethnic and spiritual diversity of several of the societies currently experiencing such historical and profound change may give rise to specific tensions and security concerns."	1
A genuine understanding of the challenges that each individual country faces is developing.	1

"""antagonisms between opposing political forces are casting a shadow on the country's recent democratic success and threatening its progress towards lasting stability"" (S/2011/540, para. 55)."	1
"In conclusion, the challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous, but we are making progress."	1
"We are concerned about the deterioration in people's living standards as a result of the difficulties that the country faced in 2008, in particular as a result of the global food crisis and the damage caused by the hurricanes that struck the island."	1
"But there was also concern because, each time there has been a hopeful sign in the Middle East, it has been met by increasing violence and destruction."	1
"In particular, I should like to emphasize that, as observed in the report, the Taliban continues to constitute a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and containing this organization is crucial."	1
"Nonetheless, Afghanistan continues to face challenges in its endeavour to achieve stability and development. Key among them are the security situation, a worsening humanitarian situation, rule of law and human rights challenges, and continued violence that has resulted in civilian casualties, which continue to increase."	1
"Fourthly, piracy off the coast of Somalia is an international problem that requires our collective efforts and contribution."	1
The Secretary-General warns in an unequivocal way that none of the eight standards has so far been entirely fulfilled.	1
"We strongly condemn this morning's vicious attack on the holy shrines of Imam Ali al-Hadi and Imam Hassan al-Askari in Samarra, and we share the outrage of the Iraqi people at that crime. It is another deliberate attempt by terrorists to sow dissent and inflame sectarian strife among the people of Iraq."	1
"It means that the secessionists continue to blatantly disregard international law, rejecting the universal principles of the United Nations Charter."	1
We stressed the tragic consequences that such messages had recently elsewhere on the continent.	1
But make no mistake; my country is equally prepared to resist UDI incessantly for as long as no compromise appears on the horizon.	1
"As of 23 June, over 1.1 million people had crossed the Libyan borders into Tunisia, Egypt, Niger, Algeria, Chad and the Sudan."	0
The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.	0
To date there has been no improvement in administrative reform at the national level.	1
We bring up the issue of violence in order to express our impatience as regards urgently finding satisfactory solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	1
I am concerned that that parliamentary vote and stalemate could disrupt the painstaking gains that Somali stakeholders and their partners have achieved.	1
"In all those discussions, I was encouraged to find a convergence of opinion: we all marvelled at how Liberia has achieved so much since the end of the fighting in 2003, but all realized fully just how breathtaking the challenges confronting Liberia still are, and that, ultimately, we take nothing for granted."	1
"Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian Ad Hoc Tribunal process, additional remedial measures may be required to achieve justice."	1
This is unacceptable and contradicts even the publicly declared ban on land mines by anti-Government forces.	1
"In their public statements, Colonel Al-Qadhafi and members of his family have continued to threaten citizens with a civil war and the possibility of mass killing if the protests continue."	1
"The Council condemns all attacks by local and foreign armed groups that threaten the population as well as the peace and stability of the Central African Republic and the subregion, including the July 19 and November 24 attacks by the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace on Birao."	1
"The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon -- which was certified by this Council six years ago -- would bring about security along their northern border, find themselves under constant Hizbollah rocket attacks, which every day reach further into Israeli territory."	1
"There has been an increase in the number of raids targeting national and international security forces, staff of public institutions and humanitarian personnel. There have been more attacks on polling sites and more threats to voter registration teams."	1
"This is made clear by recent incidents of DIS ill-discipline, notably the alleged murder of a civilian by a DIS commander in Farchana on 22 March."	1
We note that the enduring challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	1
"At the same time, my delegation considers that the elected representatives of the ethnic minorities in the Assembly, in particular the Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their electorate if they were to adopt a more participative attitude, instead of withdrawing from the legislature when they encounter a difficult situation."	1
We must not underestimate the threat posed in Afghanistan by the destabilizing activities of the Taliban and Al Qaeda.	1
"While neither side appears ready to return to war, there is a concerning pattern of escalation and destabilization that could lead to large-scale confrontation and put more civilian lives at risk."	1
"However, the situation inside Kosovo today still gives us cause for concern."	1
"Like other speakers before us, and in line with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the act that led to the death of Mr. Dzeković and the injury of several others during the protests in North Mitrovica on 2 July."	1
The meeting was called to order at 11.25 a.m.	0
We urge Israel to halt its military raids in Gaza.	1
"South Africa stresses that, given the magnitude of those challenges, a comprehensive strategy incorporating security, humanitarian efforts, good governance and socio-economic development is required."	1
Recent developments in the region reinforce the concerns consistently expressed to the mission by its interlocutors.	1
We have also noted that the spiral of violence has compelled entire populations to leave in order to escape the violence.	0
Such acts are entirely unacceptable. The Palestinian Authority must put an end to those launchings and prosecute the perpetrators.	1
"During our prior discussions, Belgium had shared the concern expressed by the Secretary-General about the danger that violence in Iraq poses to a society, institutions and a political process that remain fragile."	1
We call upon the Palestinian Authority to do all it can in order to stop those attacks.	1
"To conclude, although Timor-Leste has made significant progress it still faces many serious challenges as it seeks to establish a stable democracy and develop its economy."	0
The Palestinians and the Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees of its security as a State.	1
That is obviously because the States in question have rejected his measures.	1
"It is important to give women, who are the first victims of violence in all its manifestations, a primary role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and it is even more important and urgent to do so in the process of conflict prevention."	1
"However, challenges remain on the path to lasting peace and stabilization in Darfur."	0
Such actions are being undertaken in spite of the clearly articulated negative position taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and as a challenge to the United Nations and the Security Council.	1
The alarming drug situation requires further action.	0
"The challenge is to ensure that our outrage translates into determined and purposeful action, yielding early and measurable results."	0
They insist on treating the case as a minor migration crime.	1
I say again today what I said on 31 January (see S/PV.6710). It is unacceptable for the Council to be prevented from assuming its responsibilities.	1
His mission represents the last opportunity to prevent Syria from spiralling into civil war.	0
"That is despite repeated condemnation of those inhuman acts by the Council's resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), and 1960 (2010), which became beacons of hope for millions of women and girl victims worldwide."	1
"The second is to call once again for urgent, essential Security Council action to stem the bloodshed in Syria."	1
"We hope that, faced with this clear threat to international peace and security, the Security Council will act without employing the double standard that has characterized its past action on this matter, in order to urgently and decisively adopt the draft resolution that is being put forth by Algeria on behalf of the members of the Arab Group."	1
"The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to remind all speakers, as I indicated at the morning session, to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously."	0
"In our view, it is not primarily cross-border infiltration that is resulting in the extremist violence in Afghanistan, including in the south and the south-east."	0
The meeting was called to order at 4.10 p.m.	0
"The report before us makes for difficult reading, but it also lays down a challenge."	0
"In conclusion, in the context of world peace and the Middle East, I would like to stress that while we understand all sorts of needs arising on security, it would be better for that region and the whole world if the situation of Iran could be stopped from moving towards conflict, because it will be the sort of conflict that might have a very unfortunate impact on the world and that might be the proverbial last straw that breaks the camel's back on world peace."	0
"We are deeply concerned about the fact that violence in the Middle East is continuing to be perpetrated by one side against the other, despite the clear expression of repugnance at such a state of affairs by the international community and the Security Council."	1
It seems also that quite a few logistical requirements must be fulfilled in order to complete the handover process.	0
"Given its current political status, Kosovo remains a long way from direct foreign investment and lacks eligibility for benefiting from International Monetary Fund and World Bank programmes and assistance, which would have a direct impact on the development of a stable and efficient economy."	0
This is an important step in the right direction.	0
"Tensions along the border may also flare up into serious violence during the migration period, particularly in the Abyei area, from which neither side has fully withdrawn."	0
"That would entail more energetic measures regarding the eviction of those who, threatening violence, are illegally using Serbian property."	0
"The first is that demands for human rights and freedom are universal and will spread by themselves over time, because they are fundamental human aspirations."	0
"We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to comply with the obligation contained in resolution 2036 (2012) to ban the trade of Somali charcoal, particularly by those most active in such trade."	1
"Israel has legitimate security concerns, but they can only be fully addressed in an efficient way through a negotiated settlement."	0
"We are, at the same time, concerned by the observation contained in the report that work on the delineation of the land border between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is not proceeding expeditiously."	0
"That is important to strengthen the Mission's capacity to offer genuine protection to the Congolese civilian population, the victim of an obvious humanitarian disaster, as Mr. Doss emphasized, and of mass violations of human rights, in particular acts of violence directed against women and children."	1
"Given our role as lead nation, the United Kingdom knows, perhaps better than others around this table, just how big another long-term challenge is: that of counter-narcotics."	0
That is why I have concentrated more on the opportunities than on the challenges in my statement.	0
Steps that could undermine confidence or prejudice the outcome of negotiations must be stopped and reversed.	1
"The siege must be lifted immediately in order to allow the civilian population in Gaza to have access to water, employment, commerce, medical treatment and education -- essentially, access to their basic needs."	1
I wish to remind speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry on its work expeditiously.	0
My delegation remains concerned that the security situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate.	1
We must reject any attempts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	1
"Thus, the terrorists have failed to achieve their strategic goal of preventing large numbers of volunteers in the rebuilding of the country."	0
We were blocked from even condemning the violence and endorsing a peaceful plan developed by Syria's own neighbours.	1
"It is a significant concern that the rhetoric is heightened on both sides, the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan."	1
Egypt once again demands an immediate end to the Israeli attacks on Gaza.	1
"It outlines issues of concern and concludes with the urging of Somali women that the international community raise issues of gender, including with Somali leaders."	1
"Despite the overall progress, it must be noted that poverty and unemployment remain a formidable challenge, as underlined by Ms. Ameerah Haq."	0
We are deeply concerned that the ad hoc processes established for this purpose appear to have failed.	1
"However, the challenges involved in those will be significantly greater, as they will be one-day events and logistics will be complicated by Liberia's heavy rainy season."	0
Yet the Chad experience left a strong imprint on our peacekeepers and an awareness of the challenge confronting the United Nations in that regard.	0
"Combating that scourge requires strengthening our capacity in criminal prosecution, our judicial system, our civil police and even our prison system."	0
"We have noted with concern the Secretary-General's assessment that many factors that fuelled the 2006 crisis are still present in society, making it vulnerable to instability."	1
"We are all gravely concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d'Ivoire, as the Council has perhaps seen in my statement earlier today."	1
It also stresses that Rwanda has a duty to use its strong influence to ensure that RCD-Goma takes no such action.	1
The capacity of the national security forces to respond to such threats in remote areas is still limited because of capacity constraints.	0
"Important challenges and issues relating to security and national reconciliation should not be underestimated and require, in my view, the political attention of the Council."	0
"In accordance with those resolutions, this organ must demand that the Government of the United States immediately sentence Luis Posada Carriles for his terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose justice system has been pursuing him for years."	1
"More efforts by the Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations must be put into preventive activities, such as providing sanitation and clean water."	1
"""The Security Council expresses grave concern following the reports about the unusual, sudden influx of thousands of Misseriya into Abyei town and its environs, which could force significant changes in the ethnic composition of the area."	1
We now have to speed up work on our mutual obligations.	0
The European Union indeed believes that strong socio-economic development is required to sustain and consolidate the new-found stability.	0
"Whatever its internal capacities, no State of our region can stand along against the challenges of terrorism, secession and development, or guarantee openness and democracy."	0
Mission requirements relating to resolution 1325 (2000) were more specific and detailed during the EUFOR deployment than during the subsequent MINURCAT deployment.	0
"As serious and condemnable as that event may be, it is an isolated one."	0
"The conflicts there have complex root causes involving multiple factors, including political differences, the unequal distribution of economic resources and tribal clashes. The potential recurrence of the conflict and its spillover remains. Attaining peace will continue to require the tireless efforts of all parties."	0
All concerned must ensure that Kosovo is a place where ethnic tolerance and multiculturalism allow for peaceful coexistence among communities.	0
"I believe that, with the combination of him in that role and Ambassador Jurica as Chairman of the Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee, there is a new vitality in our work on counter-terrorism."	0
"The holding of the legislative elections without delay and in a relatively peaceful atmosphere is, in our view, a significant achievement that marked a major step forward in the restoration of constitutional order, more inclusive governance, and the completion of a key unfinished aspect of the peace process."	0
People all over the world are demanding their universal human rights.	0
"In that regard, the recommendations made by the assessment team to prevent the spread of conflicts, the destabilization of States and worsening humanitarian problems deserve close attention."	0
We urge Israel to abide by its obligations with regard to the people in the occupied territories.	1
"In post-conflict environments also, the challenges faced by women remain formidable."	0
"However, failure to actively intervene to restore stability to that country is already threatening the effectiveness of the international community in addition to costing vast amounts in resources."	1
"We continue to be concerned that, despite all attempts to restore peace and security, efforts to stabilize the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have experienced significant setbacks recently."	1
"Moreover, Chile is of the view that operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution contains a condemnation of suicide attacks against civilians only."	1
The Republic of South Sudan is extremely concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the border areas of both the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	1
"""The Council notes with concern the challenges in the area of social and economic development, as there has been a marked deterioration in the living standards of the vast majority of Haitians."	1
We see encouraging signals in this direction and meaningful accomplishments in this very important endeavour.	0
This is an international obligation that States must fulfil so as to ensure justice for the victims of these deplorable events.	1
Members of the Council should know that all necessary steps have been and will continue to be taken to arrest the guilty as quickly as possible.	0
"Not only is the election calendar coming clearly into view, but the situation along Liberia's border with Côte d'Ivoire requires close monitoring for potential security fallouts."	0
"In that context, despite counter-terrorism being taken up more seriously by the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular, there is limited evidence of a genuinely common effort to create a more unified international response to terrorism."	1
We know that conflict situations are usually characterized by the breakdown of law and order.	0
"Our primary concern in that regard is the fact that, according to the report, not one of the eight primary standards has yet been fully implemented."	1
"In the coming months, Afghanistan will face decisive challenges."	0
The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo	0
"""The Security Council notes with concern the postponement of the first round of the presidential election, scheduled for 29 November 2009 in the 18 May 2009 communiqué of the Permanent Consultative Framework of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement, which was endorsed by all the main Ivorian political actors."	1
"The monitoring and identification of arms embargo violations must be stepped up, and targeted sanctions applied when necessary, in order to reduce the potential devastating effects of that dynamic in the Somali context."	1
"Timor-Leste has taken important steps towards tackling its difficult legacy, but considerable and urgent challenges remain."	0
The protection of civilians is an obligation long ignored in Somalia.	1
The breakaway group of parliamentarians has rejected the Garowe process and has passed a motion bringing forward the presidential elections from July to 30 April this year.	1
"The overall challenge is to take the incremental steps that have been implemented, intensify and multiply them and make them transformative."	0
"First, let me stress the importance of building on the current negotiations, including both the Israel-Palestine and the Israel-Syria tracks."	0
"It is nevertheless unacceptable that Israel should cite its valid security concerns to justify measures that indiscriminately effect an entire people, in contravention of international humanitarian law."	1
"However, we are concerned that the taking of key decisions has to date been undermined by a lack of political consensus."	1
"While the leaders of the region took bold measures to combat that scourge, the Libyan crisis arose and exacerbated the situation."	0
The gender perspective must be part of the reform and training of all security forces.	1
We are concerned that the security situation remains problematic.	1
"The first is Afghanistan's drug situation, which is a serious and growing challenge not only for Afghanistan but also for the rest of the world."	0
We are concerned at the lack of political freedoms there.	1
"In that context, we reiterate our repeated affirmation that the greatest threat to the investigation lies in the fact that certain parties in and beyond our region are exploiting it in order to politicize conclusions that are entirely unrelated to the investigation and that are not based on firm evidence."	1
"The security situation, however, remains a real concern for all, despite the decrease in security related events in December 2011 and January 2012, compared to the previous two-month reporting period of last year."	1
We note that efforts to reform local government have faced delays.	0
The violence and the displacements pose an immediate challenge to the credibility of the voting process.	0
The fight against impunity is also of major importance to the prevention of sexual violence.	0
Such actions undermine the fragile foundations of Afghan statehood and impede the achievement of long-term stability.	0
"At this stage of the peacebuilding process, such conduct could tend to be misunderstood and incite violence, which could then lead to a relapse into conflict."	0
The challenge now is to build on that platform and turn the promise of peace into reality.	0
"South Africa has always been among those States that have condemned all acts of violence, terror, excessive and indiscriminate use of force, and the physical destruction of property."	0
That type of interaction can allow preventive action to be taken in reasonable time.	0
"Terrorism poses a serious challenge to our security, to the basic principles of democratic societies and to the rights and freedoms of our citizens."	0
"However, we are concerned at reports that tension between governing and opposition parties has intensified."	1
Sahelian countries are making progress in their counter-terrorism capabilities.	0
The recommendations of the mission in that regard require serious consideration.	0
"It is critical that any actions, activities or statements that could undermine or hamper the peace efforts be avoided."	0
Local government reform programmes must not await final status negotiations.	0
Elections held in the wake of a prolonged conflict are meant to create political legitimacy for the post-war order.	0
"But, as I said in Tuesday's open meeting, events must be considered in their context, and the Security Council does nothing to contribute to a peaceful settlement when it condemns one party's actions and turns a blind eye to everything else occurring in the region."	1
Perhaps the greatest long-term challenges for Timor-Leste will be socio-economic.	0
"At the same time, Cuba condemns suicide bomb attacks and other acts against Israeli civilians, who are innocent victims of the spiral of violence provoked by their Government's policy. We also object to the manipulation of such isolated acts in order to question the Palestinian people's legitimate exercise of self-defence and to justify activities, whether large-scale or selective, against the Palestinian population."	1
"First, it is important to take into account two equally legitimate desires: on the one hand, the demand of the minorities to live in safety, to have the same opportunities for economic development, to have the same access to social services and education and to exercise the right of return; on the other hand, the will of the majority of the population to exercise its right of self-determination."	0
Few Iraqi families have been spared the direct and indirect consequences of violence and human rights violations. It is natural that many of them have a deep sense of victimization.	0
“The Security Council expresses its profound concern at the humanitarian impact of the conflict on the Angolan people.	1
"This Council should not allow that strategy to be rewarded by addressing the response to terrorism instead of terrorism itself. It must be rejected, not appeased."	1
"In this regard, the Council condemns in the strongest terms ongoing threats and intimidation against UNMIS elements."	1
Allow me to begin by reiterating the European Union's deep concern about the situation in Somalia and about the regional implications of its conflict.	1
"In terms of the challenges to implementation, we believe that sustainable development cannot be achieved without institutions based on good governance or the necessary resources, which will be available only if security and stability prevail."	0
One of the key issues in a post-conflict country is security sector reform.	0
They do not recognize the illegal unilateral attempt at cessation by ethnic Albanian citizens of Kosovo.	0
"However, concerns persist in relation to the 2.3 million people who remain in crisis."	1
"However, we are concerned by recent developments, which have witnessed increased tensions between members of local communities and ISAF forces."	1
"Nevertheless, the situation continues to be one of concern given the long border separating our two countries, over which it is difficult to exercise control."	1
"I should like to draw the attention of members to document S/2005/436, which contains the text of a letter dated 26 July 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council."	0
"The exercise went well, with no major security incidents or prohibitive logistical challenges."	0
Major Palestinian factions in Lebanon expressed concern over the incidents and dissociated themselves from Fatah al-Islam.	1
The Council must call for an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces from that area.	1
"The limited capacity within the region to track financial flows is another significant challenge, especially given the risk that illicit profits may aggravate corruption."	0
"But let us be frank with each another -- there is no open question in Kosovo that is not related to status, either directly or indirectly."	0
"By entertaining initiatives that effectively reward that strategy, the Council would only embolden extremists and undermine the letter and spirit of the road map."	1
There can be no doubt that we have underestimated the humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan. John Holmes will address that in greater detail.	0
He has refused to arrest Ali Kushayb and Ahmad Harun.	1
"Throughout those difficult days and weeks, the political leaders and citizens of Kosovo managed a highly unusual situation with maturity and without any disorder or instability."	0
"In addition, we have sharpened the focus of our efforts in order to be even more effective in Afghanistan, and specifically in Kandahar province."	0
"Here at the Security Council, three cases in particular demand our attention today."	0
"A one-State solution might accommodate many fundamental Palestinian desires, but it fails to meet the essential requirement of Israelis to maintain their self-determination and sovereignty."	0
That situation persists even as the Libyan authorities have no opportunity to fully control the situation in their country or to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist elements.	0
The Palestinians must end public incitement to violence and do their utmost to stop militants from attacking Israel and thus provoking its response.	1
We are reasonably confident that these groups will not be able to undermine the electoral process at the national level.	1
"I was in Afghanistan for four days at the end of June to assess the humanitarian situation, given the growing concerns about the severity of humanitarian and protection of civilians issues."	1
Palestinians feel the struggle as a battle of resistance each and every day for their identity and against the erosion of the possibility of a future as a people.	0
"The situation on the ground is of concern also in humanitarian terms. The Secretary-General confirms that Iraq is experiencing a major crisis, stating that the situation is continuing to deteriorate."	1
"While the basic training of the police reserve unit was completed on 23 August, it is estimated that at least three more months of extensive in-service training and supervision will be required."	0
"At the same time, Germany and the EU have in the past repeatedly condemned the terrorist atrocities that have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis."	1
"Effective and sustainable democratic governance is a goal to be pursued with great determination and even a sense of urgency everywhere, Haiti being no exception."	0
There is no doubt that the structure and development of public administration in Timor-Leste still presents us with significant challenges that must be taken into consideration.	1
That makes the irresponsible and threatening rhetoric coming from the Iranian leadership all the more alarming.	1
It must retain its independence and objectivity in order to instil confidence in the electoral process.	0
"Israel is obligated under international law and as the occupying power to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, and to safeguard civilian property."	1
Improvements require the enforcement of laws -- notably the law on the elimination of violence against women -- that criminalize and penalize violence and harmful practices against women and girls.	1
"Last Sunday, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of Hamas, Hamas leader Haniyeh challenged the continuation in office of President Abbas pending a resolution of the internal divide."	1
"As we are set to discuss development challenges facing Afghanistan, the recent incident underscores the grim picture related to the security situation."	1
"In this context, the European Union reminds Israel of its obligation to ensure full and secure access for humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)."	1
"Although a senior official from the Provisional Institutions of Kosovo and Metohija recently attempted to explain that failure by citing high unemployment rates, facts point in a different direction."	0
"Thus, another critical challenge in the near future will be to build a sustainable economy that is nurtured by a culture of democratic and transparent governance that creates jobs and helps to fulfil the basic social functions of the State."	0
We consider the stance of Armenia as an open challenge to the conflict settlement process and a serious threat to international and regional peace and security.	1
"In the view of the delegation of Togo, all those issues require prompt action to prevent the Sahel region from sinking into complete insecurity, which would be very damaging to its development."	1
"At the same time, the other crucial elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by enhancing the judicial system's efficiency, impartiality and overall functioning, and enhancing law enforcement institutions in order to curb organized crime and ethnic violence and to bring all criminals to justice."	1
"This will require a clear position, particularly -- if I may speak frankly -- from the United States of America."	1
We are addressing those challenges democratically and effectively.	0
"It is clear that continued international assistance is required and that, as the Secretary General has pointed out in his report,"	0
"At the same time, President Al-Bashir is threatening the international community with retaliation and yet more crimes."	1
"In the present situation, which is extremely difficult, we call on both Israelis and Palestinians to prevent the conflict from escalating and to start implementing their obligations under the road map, in order to revive the prospects for peace."	1
We now have a better understanding of the scope of the challenges that we previously could only guess at.	0
"If such issues are settled in favour of the Prosecution, the accused persons will plead guilty to the charges against them."	0
"He added that it could undermine the peace, security and stability of the State."	0
"Despite those challenges, we cannot fail to acknowledge that approximately 50 per cent of the Afghan population lives in areas where responsibility for security has been handed over to Afghan security forces."	1
The humanitarian consequences of the continuing violence in Iraq are a matter of great concern to my delegation.	1
"Minorities, especially the Serb minority, have the fundamental obligation of engaging fully in the quest for solutions by taking advantage of all opportunities to participate in Kosovo's institutions."	0
It is indeed high time for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most basic rights of the Palestinian people and help put an end to the vicious cycle of violence brought about by the persistent and continued illegal occupation of Palestinian territories by Israel.	1
Brazil is also convinced that a stable Somalia will require a comprehensive strategy that combines security and development.	0
"All of this requires a very determined fight against entrenched informal actors, whose existence is a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of sovereignty by the Afghan State."	1
"We were disappointed, Mr. President, that, despite your efforts and those of many others, the Council was unable to condemn that heinous terrorist attack."	1
"But despite those advances, the challenges to Government authority and to its effective control over its national territory still have to be overcome."	1
"It is also indisputable that, as an occupying Power, Armenia bears direct responsibility for the commission of those offences."	1
"In order to achieve more concrete progress, the international community must act in a more concerted manner and with greater determination to put the basic framework in place."	0
Another ongoing challenge is the political stalemate within the Transitional Federal Parliament.	0
"In that context, we remain concerned about the most vulnerable in Timor-Leste: the poor and the displaced."	1
"It is part of a mantra constantly repeated before this Council that is no more true for its repetition, that ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights, and that fails to recognize the excruciating difficulties faced by Israeli forces in trying to protect their citizens and minimize harm to Palestinian lives when the terrorists they confront show as little concern for Palestinian lives as they do for Israeli ones."	1
"We note the security concerns that Israel says compel it to continue those overflights, specifically allegations of violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to resolution 1701 (2006)."	1
Today I shall just stress the following four points.	0
"Lack of land and jobs, as well as insecurity, prevent many returnees from settling in their original communities."	1
The German Government strongly condemns those acts of violence.	1
"Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): First of all, I would like to apologize for asking for the floor again. We thought that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to pass over the comments made by the representative of Armenia and his attempt to mislead the Security Council in silence."	1
The continued plight and suffering of the Palestinian people remain a tragic embodiment of the consequences of the non-implementation of resolutions and the non-enforcement of the decisions of the Security Council.	1
The meeting was called to order at 6.10 p.m.	0
"Earlier this month, Prime Minister Fayyad circulated a summary of the Palestinian reform and development plan for 2008-2010."	0
"This ugly political incident was starkly condemned in a press release issued immediately after the incident by the Office of President Ernest Bai Koroma, and in many subsequent press releases by other political interest groups, including the APC and the PMDC parties, the Independent Media Commission, the Political Party Registration Commission (PPRC) and the Campaign for Good Governance."	1
"We could go on by mentioning widespread poverty, problems in the management of natural resources, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, further thousands of former combatants waiting for reintegration, weak and unreformed security sectors, massive violations of human rights and many other threats that could possibly fuel new conflict."	1
"In that connection, we think that destructive action aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be categorically condemned."	1
"While both Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and called for the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has claimed that the other is responsible for provoking the incident."	1
"We also wish to express our concern that the recurrence of those incidents could lead to an unstable situation in the region, which would make it difficult to reach a peaceful solution to the situation of Kosovo, one acceptable to both parties."	1
Israel must also refrain from unilateral actions in Jerusalem that alter the status quo or undermine trust.	1
"Coupled with extremism, and with deep roots in the area's political and social life, organized crime threatens the very foundation of the principles and values that we are trying to instil in the new institutions formed there, thus rendering our efforts fruitless."	1
"As a consequence, a line has been crossed in relation to security threats to many countries inside and outside Africa, including members of this Council, exposing their vulnerabilities."	1
"In addition to the humanitarian challenges, the situation poses security concerns."	0
"As we have always stressed, that position implies no value judgement on the substance of the issue; it is an firm invitation to give both justice and the political process a chance."	0
"But the job is doable so long as we set principled but realistic targets and move towards them with deliberate steps, and so long as we are not alone as we take those steps."	0
"As a measure to optimize the use of the Council's time and in order to allow as many delegations as possible to take the floor, I will not individually invite speakers to take seats at the table and invite them then to resume their seats on the side."	0
"Noncompliance with obligations under the Charter should have consequences for any Member State, and the Sudan should be no exception."	1
"As I have stressed on many occasions, the security and durable stability of any country, including Timor-Leste, can be achieved only with the corresponding socioeconomic development."	0
"We believe that Somalia is facing a challenge akin to that of a marathon runner, since the drafting of the constitution must end by 20 April and its adoption completed on 22 May."	1
The impunity of such high-ranking officers is unacceptable and prevents communities emerging from conflict to recover sustainably.	1
The Afghan authorities and the international community must make it clear that this behaviour is unacceptable.	1
Pristina has thus far rejected every initiative in that regard.	1
"In that regard, the action undertaken to address serious problems in the correctional system is encouraging despite the serious challenges that still exist."	0
"Although the President acted within his constitutional prerogatives, I discussed with him concerns that the pardons issued on 25 December 2009 could exacerbate perceptions of impunity."	1
"The Arab Spring reconfirms what history warns, that when Governments respond with an iron fist to the irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands and unconquerable hopes of their citizens, they are doomed to fail in the long term."	0
The progress made -- and let there be no doubt that there has been progress -- must be seen in the context of the challenges that Kosovo has faced.	0
"First, they have created an ongoing humanitarian emergency that threatens the peace and stability of Haiti."	1
The development of effective Somali judicial capacity will also enable Somalis to tackle the scourge of terrorism and piracy.	0
It is clear that our collective efforts require significant resources and better integration -- a fact reflected in both the Bucharest and the Paris outcomes.	0
"That is why Greece had insisted on the need to clarify, in the sixth preambular paragraph -- in which the Council urges ""progress towards the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement"" -- that it should be reaffirmed that those negotiations have to take place between the two communities."	1
"In that connection, we wish to go further and say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to empower Somali security forces to subdue the most virulent insurgents and to enable the Government to extend its areas of authority as far as possible if negotiations for peace fail."	1
"In his report, the Secretary-General notes some measure of improvement in all of those areas except the central issue of local government reform and, in particular, decentralization, where progress has been lacking."	1
The intervention of the Court is must be a catalyst for decisive national and international action in response to challenges to justice in situations of conflict.	0
Some concerns have been expressed -- most recently by several presidential candidates -- about the fairness of registration.	1
"In order to continue this fight, it is imperative that the international community make a more serious contribution, and pay greater attention, to this important aspect of fighting terrorism."	1
Somalia's long-term security and stability will require a credible and effective justice system.	0
The meeting was called to order at 1 p.m.	0
"It is a difficult passage, which requires patience and persistence."	0
My delegation firmly condemns such violence and extends its condolences to the families of the deceased pediatrician.	1
"In exchange, the Belgrade authorities need to put an end to their tactic of obstruction, which prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in the public institutions of Kosovo. The ""vacant chair policy"" entails major risks that the history of Kosovo will be written without the Kosovo Serbs."	1
The Haitian National Police will need to be adequately resourced to discharge its constitutional law enforcement duties.	0
"Likewise, I can understand the need of the international community to direct its attention and resources to other hotbeds of tension around the world."	0
We are especially concerned by the uncontrolled spread of weapons in Libya and beyond its borders as a result of the conflict.	1
That would truly demonstrate the global nature of the counter-terrorism efforts of the United Nations and the fact that Member States are united.	0
That is a complex challenge for the Sahel countries and regional agencies.	0
We urge further action by Israel to remove settler outposts in accordance with the Road Map and address the growing threat of settler extremism.	1
"A greater United Nations presence is in fact vital, but in order for the value added of our Organization to be completely effective, adequate funds will need to be made available in terms of both personnel and security. Mr. Eide reminded us of that a few moments ago."	1
"As regards the military dimensions of security sector reform, the Government has made it clear that it wishes to largely rely on bilateral aid for building up the capabilities of the army."	1
"In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the continuing lack of headway in the areas of minority freedom of movement, sustainable returns and relevant minority representation in governmental structures and in the public sector as a whole."	1
My Government acknowledges the many expressions of condemnation and outrage that this atrocity has generated. We especially appreciate the Security Council's quick reaction to this gruesome crime.	1
"In fact, given the history of foreign interference, such prescriptions will not only be suspect in the eyes of various segments of society, but may also have the potential to exacerbate the problem."	1
"Above all, our concerns were related to the Pristina authorities' insistence on somehow implementing the so-called strategy for northern Kosovo in brazen breach of resolution 1244 (1999), which remains the main international legal platform for a Kosovo settlement."	1
"Members of the Council have before them document S/2005/745, which contains the text of a letter dated 7 December 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia addressed to the President of the Security Council transmitting the report of the Panel of Experts on Liberia."	0
"In particular, we would like to express our profound concern over the stagnation of Haiti's socio-economic development and food security."	1
"However, we note that without a resilient justice and security sector, the burgeoning peace and stability in the country could be threatened."	1
"The international community has clearly voiced its strong condemnation of those actions through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Group of Friends of Syria, which enjoys large and widespread participation."	1
"The five or six incidents in the border regions -- at least those reported -- have been in places such as Nangarhar and Zabul, close to Pakistan's borders."	0
"This is a matter of utmost urgency, as Kenya can no longer continue carrying the burden occasioned by the situation."	0
It is clear that the Executive Directorate must continue its efforts in order to achieve those goals.	0
"The threat to the security and stability of Afghanistan posed by terrorists, criminals and those involved in the illicit drug trade is real and needs to be continuously addressed."	1
"By the end of this year, we expect that the tools for a more effective law enforcement in the area of counter-narcotics should be in place."	0
"We condemn all acts of terrorism perpetrated in Afghanistan, especially the most recent one that occurred at the Indian embassy in Kabul, and express our condolences to the Governments and peoples of the countries affected and to the families and relatives of the victims."	1
"The collection of timely, accurate, reliable and objective information on conflict-related sexual violence is crucial to tailoring the Council's responses, as well as to enhancing action to prevent sexual violence."	1
"The genuine establishment of the rule of law in the Democratic Republic of Congo requires the formation of an army, a justice system and a police force that are effective and democratic."	1
"The international community should -- including through the auspices of the United Nations -- use diplomatic leverage and make available technical assistance in fields such as political, security and justice sector reforms, the drafting of new constitutions and legal frameworks, electoral institutions and the conduct of elections, among others."	1
Continued instability in the Sahel has implications that go far beyond the countries most directly affected.	0
It calls for adherence to international law and for implementation by the parties of their obligations and of the road map in order to achieve the vision of two States living side by side in peace and security.	1
"We cannot run the risk of having the human and financial investment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo be lost owing to the frustrations felt by the citizens, which might eventually lead to a resurgence of the crisis."	0
It would be remiss of the Council not to make use of such tools if the circumstances so demand.	0
"Under those conditions, where profound inequities and political, economic and social exclusion converge, a process aimed at transforming the prevailing order emerges and seeks economic and political changes and alternatives, allowing participation and the opening of new spaces and means of expression, which imply, in short, demands for fundamental rights."	1
ISAF troops must fully carry out their mandate to eradicate threats emanating from Afghanistan.	1
"In my delegation's opinion, in order to prevent new outbreaks of violence and instability in the northern Kosovo, it remains essential that the process of reconciliation be accompanied by policies that are aimed at guaranteeing the socio-economic stability of the communities in a non-discriminatory manner."	1
"Withholding that level of funding would cripple any Government, let alone an authority under occupation. If the funds are not immediately unblocked, this action will threaten the State-building gains made by the Palestinian Authority, including the increased good governance benefiting the Palestinian people and the development of the security forces that uphold law and order in the West Bank."	1
"As the members of the Council know better than any, the Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the greatest enduring diplomatic challenges that the world has faced since the middle of the twentieth century. At the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lies a dispute of competing and contradictory historical narratives, collective aspirations and identities."	0
Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a concern shared by the entire membership of the United Nations and the international community at large.	1
"Naturally, this has led to growing popular concern, and to questioning by some of the excessive reliance on the military option."	0
But the serious danger remains that as result of that decision -- which violates the documents of the Bonn and Berlin conferences -- the country will face an explosive situation fraught with new armed resistance and internal fragmentation of power structures.	1
"Finding a point of departure for discussions on the pending challenges that the Middle Eastern societies have found themselves facing, and extrapolating on prospective opportunities ensuing from those challenges, could be an onerous task."	0
"Addressing the causes of economic failure requires permanent projects based on sound trade and economic principles, particularly given the region's distinctive strategic location on the African continent and the fact that it has tremendous natural resources."	0
"They undertake all these actions, and then they ask for protection and guarantees and use these as a smokescreen in order to pursue their extortion and obtain more concessions from us."	1
"Since the report was issued, there has been significantly increased focus on Liberia's border with Côte d'Ivoire."	0
"In assessing that progress, it is important to recognize just how far Timor-Leste has come in the few short years since its independence, but it is equally important to acknowledge the significant challenges that remain to be faced."	0
I also wish to stress the active Arab diplomacy in the lead-up to the conference.	0
"The interdiction of illegal cross-border movement is vital to counter-terrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling."	1
"There are certainly people who feel uneasy about what they see as excessive and, indeed, negative concern with ethnic balance."	0
"In spite of the fact that more than 80 per cent of the Afghan population depends directly on agriculture for their livelihoods, only a very modest amount of money has been diverted to that sector of the economy."	0
"Unless addressed by the Government, these could pose serious threats to the security and stability of Timor-Leste."	1
"However, prevention will be effective only if peacekeeping operations have the resources they need to implement their mandate."	0
The ability of the Palestinian Authority to build credible institutions and a security infrastructure that is willing and able to combat terrorism and other threats is both an essential element of Palestinian State-building and a legitimate expectation on the Israeli side.	0
"It is obvious that ultimate progress in these areas will require further concerted efforts by the international community, Belgrade and the Kosovars."	0
Viet Nam is of the view that the diverse nature of violence against women and girls requires a comprehensive approach.	0
"Current community-based problems in Afghanistan require a comprehensive solution, including not only military and security but also political, development and economic activities."	0
"Importantly, in our view, the Conference clearly underlined the importance of Afghan leadership and, ultimately, ownership of efforts to address the key challenges facing Afghanistan -- security, lack of institutional capacity, corruption and narcotics."	0
"If a new surge in violence is to be avoided, both parties and the international community must act promptly."	1
"In order to restore real stability, there is need for a wide-ranging, comprehensive approach, including a broad set of legal, political and international tools."	0
"We strongly condemn these practices, which constitute a flagrant violation of international law and humanitarian norms. We therefore call upon the international community, the Quartet and all other stakeholders to intervene immediately and decisively to urge Israel to put an end to these actions, which pose a grave threat to peace and security in the Middle East. Violence begets only violence. The region will be caught in a vicious circle from which it will have difficulty extricating itself."	1
This is particularly true concerning the political sphere and the security situation.	0
"In that connection, we are much concerned over the security situation in Afghanistan, which has deteriorated since last year as a result of the subversive activities of residual Taliban and Al Qaeda elements, clashes between warlords and the narcotics trade."	1
Somali leaders must work towards a political process that is open to all those prepared to reject violent opposition.	1
International terrorism continues to be one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.	0
"UNMIK and KFOR demands for data regarding the presence of the ANA within the KPC were met by a very characteristic response from the commander of the Corps, who said that, under his limited powers, he could offer no more information."	1
Let me say a little about the specific proposals in the revised organizational plan and how they address those concerns.	0
It is important that the police be projected and accepted in the community as the primary law-enforcement agency.	0
"While that is constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the parties would be expected to table territorial and security proposals within 90 days, are still not taking place."	1
"While that is a good start, its long-term sustainability will be realized only if the Government makes complementary efforts to address other socioeconomic challenges."	0
We need peace to tackle other gigantic challenges as well.	0
Economic issues such as investment are also a source of great concern.	0
"In that context, Russia is convinced of the importance of devising a comprehensive international counter-narcotics strategy, including the establishment of a security belt along the Afghan borders."	0
Sierra Leone is also experiencing a surge of investment in the extractive sector.	0
"Some of those countries face immense challenges, and there will be setbacks as well as progress in the years ahead."	0
We urge the Government of Haiti to take strong measures to prevent such violence and ensure that the perpetrators of those acts are brought to justice.	1
"Subsequently, seven years later, the 2009 edition further noted that approximately 30 per cent of young people in Arab countries were unemployed, that more than 50 per cent of the population was under the age of 24, and that 51 million new jobs needed to be created by 2020 in order to avoid an increase in the unemployment rate."	0
These are issues that need to be addressed as part of the security sector reform effort.	0
"Once again, the Russian Federation calls upon the Israeli and Palestinian sides to demonstrate restraint and a high level of responsibility and to reject unilateralism."	1
I cannot stress strongly enough the risk posed by the lack of military helicopters to the operational effectiveness of the force.	1
"Questions were raised by some of our Iraqi interlocutors about what that term -- ""national reconciliation"" -- actually entails and requires."	0
"As outlined in the report, the period under review has witnessed significant advances in the peace process and in the preparations for the 2010 elections, despite some enduring challenges."	0
"Beyond the zone of responsibility of MINURCAT, in eastern Chad, other developments are also ground for concern."	1
"Also, representative democracy requires that citizens have confidence in the Governments that they elect."	0
"Also, even though the overall security situation has remained calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste's formal assumption of full responsibility for security on 20 May, smuggling, illegal trading and border-crossing should be perceived as cause for concern, as are the tensions related to the demonstrations in Dili last July."	1
Lack of participation in those institutions will prevent progress on concrete issues of public administration and will do nothing to improve Kosovo's international image.	1
"Fortunately, the choices before the Iraqi people are not black and white; nor are they zero-sum. There is a whole range of grey areas of compromise which can accommodate the essential concerns of all participants in the political process."	0
"Despite our assessment that a full ceasefire remains difficult to achieve at this time, I remain of the view that the international community must make its position clear on the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a far greater and more credible effort by Israel to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure while the conditions for such a cessation are urgently developed."	1
"The security overview of the special report of the Secretary-General (S/2008/434) suggests that, despite the relentless efforts of the Afghan people and the international community, serious challenges to peace and stabilization in Afghanistan remain."	0
"On 4 March, he urged the issuance of arrest warrants against State officials, provoking popular outrage and undermining hopes for peace and stability."	1
"Mr. Eide: I do not think that there have been any questions directed to me, but may I perhaps make a few comments."	0
"We are also concerned by the resurgence of cholera cases, although the mortality rate seems to be slowly diminishing."	1
"The tented camps have been closed and internally displaced persons are returning to a normal life, although some problems in this area still remain and require a prompt response."	0
Measures to overcome those shortcomings should address both immediate requirements and the structural deficits.	0
The President (spoke in French): I now give the floor to Ambassador José Filipe Moraes Cabral of Portugal in his capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) concerning the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.	0
"However, in 2007, after the issuance of the arrest warrant against Harun and Kushayb, President AlBashir publicly refused to implement them, challenged the Security Council's authority and stated that Harun had done what he had been ordered to do."	1
"Kosovo's current political situation presents realities that run counter to those basic assertions, and we hope that they are part of the learning process of democratic stabilization."	0
"In this context, it reaffirms that the primary cause of the crisis in Angola is the refusal by UNITA to comply with the basic provisions of the Lusaka Protocol and reiterates its demand that UNITA comply with its obligations to demilitarize and to permit the extension of State administration to territories it controls."	1
"The President emphatically described the unfortunate incident as ugly and unacceptable, inasmuch as it portends possible violence during the forthcoming 2012 elections."	1
"With the presidential elections drawing near, it is even more necessary and urgent to improve the security situation."	0
"The MDC candidate has little or no access to the Zimbabwean media; he is barred from freely campaigning; and it was reported that campaign buses and vehicles were seized by the State, allegedly for unlawful registration."	1
Bosnia and Herzegovina expresses its concern about the current political stalemate in establishing a new Government and defining a clear constitutional reform process.	1
We have to acknowledge our great concern over the ongoing situation in Afghanistan.	1
"The United Nations zero-tolerance policy for such actions must be emphasized, and there should be no impunity for those found guilty of such offences."	0
"We have appealed to the Council on several occasions to act to compel Israel to cease its military attacks, ensure protection of the civilian population and cease the illegal, punitive measures by which it is deliberately causing a human catastrophe in the Gaza Strip."	1
Cuba appears again before the Security Council to strongly denounce and condemn the complicity and absolute responsibility of the United States Government for this individual's release.	1
Africans have made very clear their concerns regarding the situation in Zimbabwe.	1
"Once again, those challenges include national reconciliation. The sharing of political power and equitable distribution of natural resources, in particular oil revenues."	0
"Moreover, the negative effect is also evident beyond its borders and not only on the African continent."	0
The European Union is gravely concerned by the ongoing cycle of retaliatory violence in Israel and the occupied territories.	1
President Al-Bashir retaliated diplomatically against the Kenyan decision and threatened economic and trade sanctions.	1
"During those considerations, the Chinese delegation has always emphasized the viewpoint that the Darfur issue involves a political process, peacekeeping deployment, economic development, humanitarian assistance and justice. It is very complex and requires tremendous political wisdom to find a comprehensive solution that ensures that peace and justice are achieved."	0
"While a leader may be ousted in a few months, establishing such a democratic society requires more time and greater sacrifices."	0
"If not, we may see more of the violent ruptures that can follow when people demand rights that no amount of coercion will ever persuade them to abandon."	0
"In that context, we believe it is important to draw the Security Council's most serious attention to the threats posed by radical and extremist religious organizations such as Hizb ut-Tahrir and urge the Council to impose the most robust sanctions against terrorist organizations."	1
It is with grave concern that I have to report a spike in criminal acts and attacks against United Nations and humanitarian personnel.	1
"In addition, Israeli aerial violations of the Blue Line have continued on a regular basis, in direct violation of resolution 1701 (2006)."	1
The Brazilian Government is closely following the current efforts by the Haitian Government to prepare institutional reforms.	0
"In this regard, we take note of the statements made by the main elected representatives of Kosovo, who immediately condemned the crime and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice."	1
"In accordance, with the understanding reached among Council members, I should like to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes, in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously."	0
"It is up to the people and leaders of the region to resist the calls of demagogues, to compromise and build coalitions, to keep faith in their system even when they lose at the polls, and to protect the principles and institutions that ultimately will protect them."	0
We feel that Palestine will remain the biggest challenge of the Middle East.	0
These relate directly to the credibility of CTED.	0
"The international community must thus take the necessary measures to prevent Israel from persisting in the deplorable, destructive policy it has begun in Gaza, and must stress its rejection of all such Israeli practices, which are a violation of international law and international humanitarian law."	1
"Although unpredicted, those changes prove an old rule of politics -- failure to reform leads to revolution."	0
That remains a source of constant concern for us.	1
"While the resolution of the six-decade tragedy of Palestine would have a profound impact on the situation in the Middle East, peace in the region also requires forward movement on the other axes of the peace process."	0
"That is also why I have deliberately avoided touching on other topics that some would consider obligatory when discussing the Middle East, such as the imperative of ending the conflict between Israel and Palestine or the situation in Syria, since we have addressed those matters in other meetings of the Council."	0
The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.	0
"But, we are also opposed to and condemn extrajudicial executions."	1
We condemn all ethnically-motivated acts and crimes in Kosovo.	1
"But we do not believe that sovereignty demands that the Council stand silent when Governments massacre their own people, threatening regional peace and security in the process."	1
No one in the region is exempt from the demands for change we have seen.	0
The security challenges emanating from the Sahelo-Sahara region are not new.	0
"Here also, we received responses that seemed to justify our concerns."	0
"As the Prosecutor, I will deal with any judicial challenge brought by President Al-Bashir and other suspects in court."	1
"We should avoid easy answers and claiming that the Sahel has always faced such challenges, when in actual fact it is well known that they were not previously of this magnitude."	0
"Due to the upsurge in violence, Karni was closed between 15 and 20 May and has reopened only sporadically since then."	0
"The nature of the terrorist threat varies from State to State and region to region, as do State counter-terrorism capabilities and needs."	0
"Timor-Leste's international guarantors of security, the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) and UNMIT, no longer face the same challenges they faced two or three years ago."	0
Azerbaijan's refusal to engage in direct negotiations with the elected representatives of Nagorny Karabakh is one of the main impediments to the resolution of the conflict referred to by the representative of Azerbaijan.	1
"Undeniably, how to improve the security situation is the biggest challenge that Iraq now faces. It will determine the future course of political, economic and social development in Iraq."	0
The Secretary-General and his Special Coordinator for Lebanon have issued statements strongly condemning the criminal actions of Fatah al-Islam as attacks on Lebanon's stability and sovereignty.	1
The United States urges the United Nations and the HNP to redouble the vetting efforts.	1
"When addressing the situation of Haiti in the framework of the United Nations, attention almost always centers on so-called security matters, which for all practical purposes minimizes the urgent attention to the serious structural, economic and social problems of the country."	1
"Regarding the humanitarian situation, Guatemala is concerned that, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 20 million people in the Sahel require humanitarian assistance, particularly in Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad."	1
The first concerns the fight against impunity.	0
"Secondly, there are fears concerning the deterioration of trust between the opposition and the ruling party."	0
"From that point of view, re-establishing peace, security and national unity are the first challenges to be met."	0
We are also concerned at the very high unemployment rate and the widespread poverty in the country.	1
"A comprehensive approach, under complete Afghan ownership, is essential to address that challenge."	0
"My first comment concerns the situation on the ground, which is clearly of concern."	0
Meeting those standards requires that more competences and responsibilities be transferred to the local authorities and that privatization be accelerated.	0
"After initial hesitations, the party chose to solve this challenge within the law and its own party constitution by holding new elections for its party delegates."	0
"It has been our view that the process must be conducted in a way that allows all Afghans equally to take part in the elections, while taking into account the difficulties we encounter with regard to security."	0
Issues were also raised concerning the delineation of the roles and responsibilities of the PNTL and the Falintil-Forças de Defesa de Timor-Leste.	0
"Thirdly, the humanitarian situation in Somalia remains a matter of concern."	0
Adequate and timely resources are required to sustain processes that are meant to be lengthy and complex.	0
But we are concerned that violence could cause part of the population to stay away from polling sites in the south and elsewhere.	1
"The Rome Statute, adopted earlier that very year, represented a tremendous step forward by incorporating, for the first time and explicitly in an international legal framework, sexual violence such as rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution and forced pregnancy. It did so in a way that makes their prosecution a practical possibility."	0
Cholera continues to pose a serious threat.	0
"Since the beginning of the political impasse following the 29 March elections, the Secretary-General has expressed his concern about the process and the politically motivated violence."	1
"In other areas, however, progress has not met expectations, and many challenges remain."	1
Relevant progress has also been achieved in the areas of public administration and law enforcement.	0
The meeting was called to order at 1.05 p.m.	0
I believe that our friends at the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and our allies are well aware of what those requirements are.	0
"My Government believes not only that they are contrary to international law but also that they undermine the concept of the rule of law, which is a key element in the fight against terrorism."	1
"To achieve peace, security and stability in that nation requires, first of all, the elimination of poverty and underdevelopment."	0
"However, much more remains to be done, primarily in the areas of the rule of law, law enforcement, Government capacity, development, the private sector and the personal security of all Afghan citizens."	0
We challenge anyone to say that there is now one single outbreak of violence or battle happening anywhere in the Sudan.	1
Romania emphasizes once again that any terrorist act is unacceptable and must be condemned.	1
The French authorities are extremely concerned by the ongoing deterioration in the situation in the northern part of the Gaza Strip over the past week.	1
"When I had the opportunity to address the Council on this issue in February (see S/PV.5130), I said that the protection of minority communities, the return of refugees and displaced persons, freedom of movement and decentralization were areas that needed particular attention, given their direct link to our common goal of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo."	0
The conference also reminded us of the difficult challenges that lie ahead.	0
That worrying pattern of activity is a matter of grave concern that threatens to seriously undermine the integrity of United Nations operations.	1
That is why we condemn terrorism.	1
"""The Security Council remains seriously concerned by the security situation in Central African Republic."	1
"That is unacceptable and must be categorically condemned, particularly by the Security Council, using the means that it has at its disposal."	1
The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains a source of major concern.	1
The meeting was called to order at 3.25 p.m.	0
What everyone needs to do is to reject the extremist voices thatwho find comfort in the old ways and thatwho believe that it is impossible for Serbs and Albanians to normalize their relations by reaching an historic compromise.	1
"The crisis, which has become a tougher challenge than ever, can no longer be ignored."	0
"The first edition, published in 2002, noted that the freedom deficit in the Arab world undermined human development and was one of the most painful manifestations of lagging political development."	0
The situation along Lebanon's border with Syria also remains a concern.	1
"But let us not mislead ourselves: this is a challenge for all of Kosovo, and not only for a minority."	0
"Certain allegations that have appeared in the press are based purely on speculation, and it is important that the investigation be conducted with the calm that this kind of situation demands."	0
Somalis should take over responsibility for providing their own security and developing their own justice system in order to deal with threats to their security.	0
"""The Security Council also expresses its concern at the rising tensions in the Ituri region and calls on all parties to exert restraint."	1
Blue Nile state also remains a source of concern for us.	1
"Therefore, the counter-terrorism bodies of the United Nations should address such shortcomings more seriously and with more dedication."	1
"Indeed, Azerbaijan is itself in violation of those resolutions, which urge the parties concerned to pursue negotiations within the framework of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as through different contacts between them."	1
"I expressed the deep concern of this Council and of the Secretary-General over the recent increase in North-South tensions, as well as the continued lack of progress on Abyei and other post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues."	1
The Russian Federation registers its deep regret and concern regarding information on the ongoing violence in Darfur.	1
I am gravely concerned about the latest escalation between Gaza and Israel.	1
"It is clear that these circumstances represent the single greatest obstacle to stability and progress in Afghanistan and that, if allowed to continue, they threaten to undo the progress made over nearly three years."	1
Promoting security and stability remains a vital challenge.	1
"However, the process has also illustrated how significant the challenges still are to Liberia's security sector, especially with regard to the logistics, communications and mobility capacities of the police and the immigration service."	1
Pakistan is extremely concerned at the report's conclusion that the humanitarian and economic challenges confronting the Sahel region have been exacerbated by the fallout from the Libyan crisis.	1
"We particularly condemn any attempts to force UNMIK into any kind of so-called co-governance, as well as any interference with the reserved powers of the Special Representative."	1
We note that civil society organizations have expressed their strong concerns in this regard.	1
It is clear that all of the institutions of law and order in Iraq face severe challenges.	1
"Political pressure on UNMIK has significantly increased, with attempts to challenge its role under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework."	1
There is no doubt today that the true intention was to prevent the details of his mindlessly destructive actions under CIA orders from becoming public.	1
"The Government also shares a certain number of the concerns expressed in the report on, among other issues, human rights and the situation of women and children."	1
We have a serious concern about that regulation. It could have consequences that are too far-reaching.	1
"We believe, however, than an abrupt withdrawal would be counterproductive and create an unprecedented vacuum, particularly given the fact that conditions conducive to the hoped-for large-scale investment and sustainable development are not yet entirely established."	1
"At the outset, I must express our strong concern about the security situation in the country."	1
"I must say that the theme chosen for our debate today, while captivating, poses a great challenge."	1
"As the Secretary-General's report (S/2004/634) makes clear, tackling the problem is a daunting challenge."	1
"However, my delegation notes with regret that the security situation remains a concern."	1
I urge Hamas to respond positively to those exhortations.	1
"He firmly reiterated his personal condemnation of the incident, which he said was sending very undesirable and wrong signals ahead of the 2012 elections, and which could potentially negate and derail the national gains made in terms of rebranding the country's image, peacebuilding and peace consolidation, which were so painstakingly achieved with the help of our development partners and the international community."	1
"Sadly, the current Palestinian leadership has shown that it is as incapable of being a partner in peace as it is of offering its people reform and democratic rule."	1
"First and foremost, concerns on the security front continue to remain paramount."	1
It is clear that requirements for invoking this mechanism have not been met in the case of Darfur.	1
"First, while Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West Africa Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere hinders intelligence-sharing and early warning."	1
France vigorously condemns that attacks and calls on all parties to exercise utmost restraint.	1
"The political debate is likely to intensify, with several elections-related challenges already in the courts."	1
"The report confirms a worrying picture of the situation in the Sahel region and related security, economic and humanitarian concerns."	1
"Secondly, Mr. Covic expressed concern over the quality of democracy in a place where the minority -- the Kosovo Serbs -- risks being outvoted. I would say that I find that the most important aspect of democracy is indeed that one participates, exercises the rights of a democracy and votes."	1
We express our grave concern regarding the plight of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	1
"In Egypt, we continue to urge a peaceful and early transfer of power to a civilian Government."	1
"The situation of minorities is still a reason for concern, especially regarding freedom of movement and access to justice."	1
"Once again, we condemn the killing of civilians, whether on the Palestinian or the Israeli side."	1
High priority must now be accorded to the challenge of establishing local and regional administrations in regions recovered from Al-Shabaab.	1
Letter dated 26 July 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council (S/2005/436)	0
We urge all parties to act with restraint and to avoid provocative actions or pronouncements that may trigger further violence.	1
The United States urges the authorities in Haiti to fulfil their pledge to fill all the six vacancies at the Cour de Cassation Supreme Court by 3 October 2011.	1
We are concerned that the success of the presidential elections runs the risk of being eroded by the lack of progress in establishing Government.	1
The challenges facing the country require Haitian leaders to forge a common bond.	1
"However, the potential remains for a complete breakdown of law and order, in addition to a collapse of the fragile economy and the disintegration of the institutions of Palestinian self-rule."	1
"The negative impact of the Libyan situation will continue to grow, posing a sustained threat to peace and stability in the region. China expresses its grave concern in this regard."	1
"It remains a great concern of mine that efforts by the Liberians to rebuild their court system will require a considerable amount of time, and so the system itself will likely remain weak and penetrable in the short term."	1
"In 1993, that vision was blurry at best. At the time, it was impossible to define end goals that would have come close to satisfying the concerns of both peoples."	1
"We have noted the caution expressed by the Secretary-General and the technical assessment mission with regard to security sector reform, and especially with regard to the PNTL."	1
Such false accusations run counter to reason and to the basic standards of a professional attitude. I am quite certain that the Council will dismiss them.	1
"The concern for the implementation of the joint communiqué of 2 April 2009, alluded to in the report, is well noted."	1
This has provoked serious tensions with local communities as well as threats against MONUC by some former CNDP military commanders now integrated in the FARDC.	1
We consider any deviation from that principle unacceptable lest the fragile situation in the province descend into widespread destabilization.	1
"Haitian political and civil society leaders continue to clamour for national consensus in key areas, such as the national budget, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and constitutional reform."	1
"The Government of Jordan stresses the need for the Israeli Government fully and immediately to halt its acts of violence and destruction in the Gaza Strip and throughout the occupied Palestinian territory, to put an end to its policy of deliberate destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and homes and to cease forthwith its acts of extrajudicial killing, the imposition of collective punishment and its other practices against the Palestinian people."	1
"However, we are still concerned that there is an overemphasis on visits to developing countries."	1
"As UNAMA, we would be irresponsible if we did not appeal to the international community, to the Government of Pakistan and to the Government of Afghanistan and its national forces to put an end to that situation, particularly on the southern border."	1
"While Hizbollah's actions are deplorable and, as I have said, Israel has a right to defend itself, the excessive use of force is to be condemned."	1
"The new democratic Government of Pakistan has inherited imposing political, economic and security challenges."	1
"The further development of the situation in that direction would threaten efforts to restore and rebuild the country, and in the long term would threaten peace and stability throughout the region."	1
We have fenced off a 25-kilometre stretch of the border and installed search lights and video cameras at border crossings.	0
"As Council members are aware, the North-South migration has begun and, for the first time, will involve crossing an international border."	0
It cannot be in the interests of the Palestinian people for essential cornerstones of Palestinian legitimacy and national aspirations to be challenged.	0
The situation in Syria is a source of deep and growing concern for the United Nations.	1
We are particularly concerned about the lack of training for mid-level civil servants and the major shortcomings still present in the judicial area.	1
"While outside the mandate of UNMISET, the recent rulings by an appeals court in Indonesia, in overturning four Ad Hoc Human Rights Tribunal convictions, directly impacts on the larger issue of achieving accountability."	1
The meeting was called to order at 10.55 a.m.	0
I am particularly concerned over the instability that could arise should the political and socio-economic situations continued to deteriorate.	1
The United States must abandon the deliberate disregard and neglect that have been its practice for nearly seven years and led to the deterioration of the situation in the region.	1
"However, these were not of a magnitude to undermine the process. Simple logistics will make it difficult to successfully vote twice on election day."	0
We are also concerned about the situation faced by those who are participating in the reconstruction of the country.	1
We are seriously concerned by the obstinate refusal of the leaders of such groups as the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement to participate in the talks.	1
The Council condemns all unilateral actions meant to create facts on the ground that would prejudice the outcome of negotiations.	1
"The Council stresses that all those responsible for violations of international law, including humanitarian and human rights law, as well as those who ordered those acts, will be held accountable."	1
"Statements such as ""the Palestinian people do not love their children"" or ""the Palestinian people send their children to die because of their hatred of Israel"" are statements that are full of racism and that reflect a kind of attitude that should be rejected out of hand -- and I am trying to do that now."	1
"Shifting the blame, finding scapegoats for failures in Afghanistan and asking those who are already doing more to do even more is unfair and unacceptable and will be ultimately self-defeating."	1
We cannot send the message that terrorists will be immune and satisfy ourselves with routine condemnations.	1
"Many achievements have been made, but many challenges remain on the road ahead."	0
The recent issuance by the Council of Ulemas of a religious decree condemning narcotics and other related activities can be instrumental in discouraging the cultivation of opium poppy.	1
We would therefore urge the members of the Council and the Group of Friends to have a favourable view of these recommendations by the Secretary-General.	1
"Seemingly, the population not only aspires but also demands that more plural and representative Governments generate tangible benefits for the citizens."	1
"Timor-Leste continues to face important challenges in reducing poverty and creating employment opportunities, in particular for its youth population."	1
"In the light of recent experiences, it is also clear that the Court will continue to face some serious challenges."	0
Another election-related challenge is the significant number of potential voters who cannot afford the administrative costs related to acquiring a national identity card.	0
The Council demands that the Government of the Sudan withdraw immediately from the Abyei area.	1
Security sector reform remains one of the major challenges for long-term peace and stability.	1
Uganda believes that ending impunity is the only credible deterrent against crimes of the most serious concern to the international community.	1
"We are gravely concerned that, unless strong will is exercised on all sides to curtail terrorism and violence, the peace process will not succeed."	1
"We note that, in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo."	1
Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continuing illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.	1
We were therefore disappointed that the Secretary-General's report (S/2011/540) recommended only a partial drawdown of surge forces.	1
"But now, what Afghanistan has accomplished is being greatly corroded by serious challenges to the country's security and stability."	1
"While piracy along the coast of Somalia remains a critical challenge, we call on the international community not to forget that the solution to that problem will have to come from land, not sea. The comprehensive resolution of the Somali conflict must address all the root causes of piracy and the other challenges, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic wastes."	1
The second point I would like to underscore today is our continuing concern for the welfare of the innocent people of Gaza and in the towns and cities of southern Israel.	1
"Finally, Afghan leadership is urgently needed to tackle narcotics."	1
I also condemn Hizbollah's reckless disregard for the wishes of the elected Government of Lebanon and for the interests of the Lebanese people and the wider region.	1
"""The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks that occurred in Algiers on 11 December 2007 near the Supreme Court and the United Nations offices, causing numerous deaths and injuries, and expresses its deep sympathy and condolences to the victims of this heinous act of terrorism and their families, and to the people and the Government of Algeria."	1
The meeting was called to order at 4.05 p.m.	0
"I also remember well how unpopular it was to speak to Israelis of the 1967 borders, and it was almost inconceivable for a long time to propose the evacuation of Israeli settlements."	1
The Secretary-General's latest report on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) clearly expressed the importance of Hizbollah disarmament and of ending arms smuggling across the Lebanese-Syrian border.	1
"Needless to say, there are no ongoing patterns of sexual violence in Kenya today, and none of the activities reported concerning Kenya took place during the current reporting period of 2010-2011."	0
"""At its 4597th meeting, held in private on 8 August 2002, the Security Council considered the item entitled `The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo'."	0
I have condemned the terrorist attack against the Indian embassy in Kabul.	1
We are concerned about the increased insurgency in certain parts of Afghanistan.	1
"Indeed, more than half of the African issues of concern to and on the agenda of the Council have related to the countries of the Great Lakes -- Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, northern Uganda, the Sudan and the Central African Republic."	0
Today's debate addresses an urgent matter.	1
It is crucial that domestic violence and sexual assault cases be formally prosecuted in accordance with the new Criminal Code.	1
That may perhaps be due to a sense of urgency as well as the Council's own limitations as an intergovernmental political body of a basically executive nature.	0
"It demands that Israel, the occupying authority, abide by all the rules of international law and the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, in addition to relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions."	0
This basic obligation cannot be flouted by States without their suffering the consequences of their anti-juridical conduct.	1
"I had hoped that the new Special Coordinator could be with us today, but the Secretary-General has dispatched him urgently to the region."	0
My country has repeatedly expressed its concern for the civilian population in that area and its view that it is important for MONUC to be deployed there in order to protect them.	1
"The incident in northern Mitrovica clearly showed that, despite the Security Council's mandate concerning the reconfiguration of UNMIK, EULEX is increasingly departing from the status-neutral principle, which undermines the standing of that international presence."	1
