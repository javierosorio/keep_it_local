2004/s/pv_4934/97:2	As the representative of Algeria pointed out a moment ago, the draft resolution that was not adopted clearly contained a condemnation of all terrorist attacks against civilians in addition to all acts of violence and destruction.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/375:4	Sometimes, in order to camouflage these facts, they disguise themselves in military clothing to send false messages saying that the official armed forces are the ones practicing this violence.	3
2005/s/pv_5243/36:1	The session opened at 10.18 p.m.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/65:6	Their responsibility is more important than his direct responsibility, but less than the responsibilities of others who operate on a more global scale.	3

2005/s/pv_5202/36:1	The session opened at 20:20.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/132:3	We condemn the excessive use of force by the Israeli army in densely populated areas, which inflicts widespread suffering and losses on large numbers of Palestinian civilians, including children.	3

2012/s/pv_6734/270:1	In this regard, I would like to emphasize once again that, unlike some other well-known cases involving illegitimate and unfounded territorial claims, including under the trumped-up pretext of patronage of ethnic minorities, the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination and to establish Country.	3

2007/s/pv_5800/46:1	“The Security Council reaffirms its condemnation of all assassinations targeting Lebanese leaders, especially those that have occurred since October 2004, and demands an immediate end to the use of intimidation and violence against representatives of the Lebanese people and their institutions.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/270:2	The Cuban delegation strongly condemns the attacks against Palestinian civilians and the general destruction caused by the Israeli occupation forces in the northern Gaza Strip.

2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/275:2	These positions are considered indirect participation in obscuring the positions of the Syrian government regarding what is happening on its territory, and irresponsible incitement to violence in all its forms, which would give international cover for the terrorist acts carried out by armed groups against the interests of the Syrian people and government.	0
2011/s/pv_6490/50:1	Let&#39;s be frank: these reports from the press, human rights groups and civilians on the ground raise serious concerns about the nature and scope of the conflict.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/171:2	Leaders of the provisional institutions of self-government often evade their responsibilities under resolution 1244 (1999) and the constitutional framework.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/200:1	Among these concerns, one concern must be highlighted, which is the deteriorating security situation in recent weeks and months.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/53:2	It is with great concern that I must report to you again today that, despite the great efforts of UNAMID, the security situation in Darfur has not improved significantly.	3

2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/123:2	We are concerned about the deterioration of the living standards of the people as a result of the hardships faced by the country in 2008, in particular as a result of the global food crisis and the damage caused by the hurricanes that struck the island.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/255:1	But there was also concern because every glimmer of hope in the Middle East was met with escalating violence and destruction.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/99:2	In particular, I would like to stress, as stated in the report, that the Taliban continue to represent a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and that containing that organization is crucial.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/124:1	However, Afghanistan still faces challenges in its quest for stability and development. The main challenges include the security situation, the worsening humanitarian situation, challenges related to the rule of law and human rights, and continuing violence, leading to increasing civilian casualties.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/289:1	Fourth, piracy off the coast of Somalia is an international problem that requires our collective efforts and contributions.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/144:2	The Secretary-General warns unequivocally that he has not yet fully met any of the eight criteria.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/72:2	We strongly condemn the brutal attack that took place this morning on the shrine of Imams Ali al-Hadi and Hassan al-Askari in Samarra, and we share the Iraqi people’s feeling of anger over this crime. It is another planned attempt by terrorists to sow the seeds of discord and ignite the flames of sectarian conflict among the people of Iraq.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/57:6	This means that the separatists continue their blatant disregard for international law and rejection of the universal principles of the United Nations Charter.	3

2012/s/pv_6729/65:1	I am concerned that this parliamentary vote and the stalemate within Parliament could lead to the hard-won gains of the Somali stakeholders and their partners being wasted.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/75:5	In all these discussions, I was heartened to discover a convergence of views: we all marvel at how much Liberia has achieved since the fighting ended in 2003, but everyone is fully aware of the magnitude of the challenges that still face Liberia, and that we take nothing for granted. Of him in the end.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/98:4	Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian ad hoc court process, additional remedial measures may be required to achieve justice.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/61:4	This is unacceptable, and even contradicts the declared ban by anti-government forces on the use of landmines.	3

2004/s/pv_5025/228:5	The number of attacks targeting national and international security forces, employees of public institutions, workers in the humanitarian fields, and representatives of countries has increased. Attacks against polling sites also increased and threats against voter registration teams increased.	3
2009/s/pv_6111/60:4	Recent incidents of indiscipline in the Integrated Security Detachment have made this clear, in particular the allegation that an Integrated Security Detachment commander killed a civilian in Farshana on 22 March.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/309:2	We note that the continuing challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/137:1	At the same time, my delegation believes that elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, especially Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their constituents if they adopted a more participatory approach, rather than withdrawing from the Assembly whenever they faced a difficult situation.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/229:2	We should not underestimate the seriousness of the threat posed by the destabilizing activities of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.	3
2011/s/pv_6656/57:2	While neither side appears ready to return to war, there is a worrying pattern of escalation and destabilization that could lead to a large-scale confrontation that could put more civilian lives at risk.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/35:1	The session opened at 10.3 p.m.	0

2012/s/pv_6709/56:1	Recent developments in the region confirm the concerns long expressed to the Mission by its interlocutors.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/199:1	We also note that the escalation of violence forces residents of entire regions to leave to flee the violence.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/186:2	These actions are completely unacceptable. The Palestinian Authority must put an end to these attacks and prosecute their perpetrators.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/252:1	From our previous discussions, Belgium shared the Secretary-General&#39;s concern about the danger that the violence in Iraq poses to a society, institutions and political process that is still fragile.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/138:2	We call on the Palestinian Authority to do everything in its power to stop these attacks.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/216:1	In conclusion, despite the great progress achieved by Timor-Leste, it still faces many serious challenges as it seeks to achieve stable democracy and develop its economy.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/252:5	The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees for its security as a state.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/187:2	It is clear that this was due to the aforementioned countries&#39; rejection of his measures.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/387:2	It is important to give women, who are the primary victims of violence in all its manifestations, a major role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and what is even more important and urgent is to do so in the process of conflict prevention.	3
2010/s/pv_6365/52:4	However, challenges remain on the path to achieving lasting peace and stability in Darfur.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/171:4	These measures are being taken despite the clear negative position taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and are considered a challenge to the United Nations and the Security Council.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/124:2	The alarming drug situation requires further action.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/233:1	The challenge is to ensure that our anger is translated into specific, purposeful action that produces early, measurable results.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/254:4	Rather, they insist on treating the case as a secondary immigration crime.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/97:2	I also say today what I said on January 31. (See session S/PV.6710). It is unacceptable to prevent the Council from assuming its responsibilities.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/168:2	His mission represents the last chance to prevent Syria from sliding into civil war.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/353:5	This is despite the repeated condemnation of these inhumane acts by Security Council Resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), which have become a source of hope for millions of women and girls victims around the world.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/66:5	The second reason is to once again call on the Security Council to undertake urgent and necessary action to stop the bloodshed in Syria.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/273:1	In the face of this blatant threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without resorting to the double standards that characterized its previous work in this regard, so that it can urgently and decisively adopt the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the members of the Arab Group.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/40:1	The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to remind all speakers, as I indicated in the morning session, to limit their statements to no more than five minutes, so that the Council can complete its work quickly.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/324:2	In our view, cross-border infiltration is not the primary cause of violence committed by extremists in Afghanistan, including in the south and southeast.	0
2010/s/pv_6431/36:1	The session opened at 10:16.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/253:1	Despite the difficulties we face when reading the report before us, it identifies the challenges facing us.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/291:1	In conclusion, in the context of peace in the world and the Middle East, I would like to stress that while we understand all the emerging and security-related needs, it is better for that region and the world at large if the situation in Iran is stopped from moving towards conflict because it would be the kind of conflict that could It has a very unfortunate impact on the world, as it will be the last straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back in terms of world peace.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/153:1	We are deeply concerned by the fact that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated by one side against the other, despite the clear expressions of disgust by the international community and the Security Council.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/176:3	It also appears that quite a few logistical needs must be met in order for the delivery to be completed.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/317:3	Kosovo, given its current political position, is still far from foreign direct investment and lacks eligibility to benefit from IMF and World Bank programs and assistance, which would have a direct impact on the creation of a stable and efficient economy.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/215:4	This is an important step in the right direction.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/56:3	Tensions along the border could turn into serious violence during the migration period in the Abyei Area, from which neither side has completely withdrawn.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/97:3	This will require more forceful measures to expel those who, through threats of violence, illegally use Serb property.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/71:2	The first is that claims to human rights and freedom are universal and will become universal over time, because they are basic human aspirations.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/195:7	We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to comply with the commitment set out in resolution 2036 (2012) to ban trade in Somali charcoal, in particular by those most active in this trade.	3
2007/s/pv_5798/46:1	“The Security Council also reaffirms the need to combat, by all means and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security posed by terrorist acts.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/172:6	Israel has legitimate security concerns, but those concerns can only be fully and effectively addressed through a negotiated settlement.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/230:1	At the same time, we are concerned by the observation in the report that work on demarcating the land border between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is not progressing quickly.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/65:2	This is important to strengthen the Mission&#39;s ability to provide meaningful protection to the Congolese civilian population, which has fallen victim to a clear humanitarian catastrophe, as Mr. Doss emphasized, and to widespread human rights violations, in particular acts of violence against women and children.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/185:1	The UK knows, perhaps better than others around this table, given our role as a leading nation, how great another long-term challenge is: that of drug control.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/114:2	Therefore, I focused more on opportunities than challenges in my statement.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/220:1	Actions that may reduce confidence in or harm the outcome of negotiations must stop and be reversed.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/219:4	The blockade must be lifted immediately to allow the civilian population of Gaza to access water, work, trade, medical care and education - that is, their basic needs.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/263:1	I would like to remind speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes so that the Council can complete its work quickly.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/218:1	My delegation remains concerned about the continued deterioration of the security situation in Iraq.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/151:3	We must reject any attempts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/92:3	Thus, the terrorists failed to achieve their strategic goal of preventing the participation of large numbers of volunteers in rebuilding the country.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/135:3	We were prevented from even condemning the violence and supporting a peace plan drawn up by Syria&#39;s neighbors.	0
2011/s/pv_6656/93:1	Of great concern is the intense rhetoric from both sides, the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/247:1	Once again, Egypt demands an immediate halt to Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/246:3	It outlines issues that require attention and concludes - with the encouragement of Somali women - that the international community should raise issues of gender equality, including with Somali leaders.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/185:1	Despite the overall progress, it must be noted that poverty and unemployment still pose a huge challenge, Ms. Amira Haq stressed.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/255:2	We are deeply concerned that the ad hoc process created for this purpose has failed.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/51:2	However, the challenges involved will be much greater, as they will be single-day events, and logistics will be complicated by Liberia&#39;s heavy rainy season.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/252:2	However, the Chad experience has left a strong imprint on European peacekeepers, and has heightened our awareness of the challenge facing the United Nations in that regard.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/111:4	Combating this scourge requires strengthening our criminal prosecution capacity, our judicial system, our civilian police, and even our prison system.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/257:2	We have noted with concern the Secretary-General&#39;s assessment that many of the factors that sparked the 2006 crisis remain in society, making it vulnerable to instability.	3
2011/s/pv_6490/42:1	We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d&#39;Ivoire, as the Council may have attested in the statement I made earlier today.	0
2002/s/pv_4583/45:2	He also stresses that it is Rwanda&#39;s duty to use its strong influence to ensure that the RCD does not take such actions.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/68:1	The ability of national security forces to respond to these threats in remote areas remains limited by capacity constraints.	3
2012/s/pv_6708/46:4	The important challenges and issues related to security and national reconciliation that, in my view, require the political attention of the Council should not be underestimated.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/260:2	In accordance with these decisions, this body must demand that the United States government immediately issue a sentence against Luis Posada Carriles for committing terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose judicial system has been pursuing him for years.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/154:2	More efforts must be made by the Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations in preventive activities, such as providing sanitation and safe water.	3

2008/s/pv_5930/361:2	We must now accelerate action to implement our mutual commitments.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/137:2	The European Union truly believes that strong socio-economic development is required to maintain and consolidate the nascent stability.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/216:1	Whatever its own capabilities, any country in our region cannot confront the challenges of terrorism, secession, and development alone and win the stakes of openness and democracy.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/251:3	The mission&#39;s requirements related to resolution 1325 (2001) were more specific and detailed during the deployment of EUFOR compared to the subsequent deployment of UNMIS forces.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/143:1	As serious and reprehensible as this incident is, it is an isolated incident.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/135:2	Conflicts have complex root causes that involve multiple factors, including political differences, unequal distribution of economic resources, and tribal clashes.

2004/s/pv_5024/151:4	This is an international obligation that States must fulfill to ensure justice for the victims of these reprehensible acts.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/103:1	He informed councilors that all necessary steps have been taken and will continue to be taken to arrest the perpetrators as quickly as possible.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/60:2	Not only is the election schedule clearly visible, but the situation along Liberia&#39;s border with Côte d&#39;Ivoire requires close monitoring for potential security implications.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/234:1	In this regard, although the fight against terrorism is being treated more seriously by the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular, there is limited evidence of real joint efforts to find a greater international response to terrorism.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/55:1	We know that conflict situations are often characterized by a breakdown of law and order.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/224:3	Our main concern in that regard is the fact that, for the report, none of the eight key standards have yet been fully implemented.	0

2010/s/pv_6276/298:3	Timor-Leste has made important steps towards addressing its difficult legacy, but significant and pressing challenges remain.	3
2010/s/pv_6259/66:4	Protecting civilians is a duty that has long been ignored in Somalia.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/64:3	The dissident group of parliamentarians rejected the Garowe process and put forward a proposal to move the presidential elections forward from July to April 30 this year.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/73:1	The overall challenge is to take the incremental steps that have been implemented, intensify them and make them transformative.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/134:1	First, let me stress the importance of building on the current negotiations, including the Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Syrian tracks.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/239:5	However, it is unacceptable for Israel to use its legitimate security concerns as a justification for imposing measures that affect an entire population in an arbitrary manner and in violation of international humanitarian law.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/252:3	But we are concerned that a key factor in decision-making is being undermined by the lack of political consensus.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/188:3	While the region&#39;s leaders took bold measures to combat this scourge, the Libyan crisis erupted and exacerbated the situation.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:3	A gender perspective must be part of the reform and training of all security forces.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/117:1	We are concerned that the security situation remains problematic.	3

2004/s/pv_5025/182:2	We are concerned about the lack of political freedoms there.	0
2006/s/pv_5597/80:2	In this regard, we would like to repeat what we said on previous occasions, which is that the most dangerous thing this investigation faces is the continued exploitation of some parties, in our region or outside it, of the investigation proceedings to jump to preconceived political conclusions that are not relevant to the requirements of the investigation and are not based on evidence. And solid evidence.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/212:1	However, the security situation remains a cause for everyone&#39;s concern, despite the decrease in the number of security-related incidents in December 2011 and January 2012, compared to the previous two months last year.	3

2004/s/pv_5049/256:1	South Africa has always been among the countries that have condemned all acts of violence, terrorism, indiscriminate use of force and physical destruction of property.	3

2005/s/pv_5188/177:5	Local government reform programs should not wait for final status negotiations.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/51:8	Elections held after a long conflict are meant to establish political legitimacy for a post-war regime.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/49:3	But, as I said in Tuesday&#39;s open session, events must be viewed in their context, and the Security Council will do nothing to contribute to achieving a peaceful settlement when it condemns the actions of one of the parties and turns a blind eye to anything else that happens in the region.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/65:1	Perhaps the greatest long-term challenges facing Timor-Leste will be social and economic.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/272:3	At the same time, Cuba condemns suicide bomb attacks and other acts against Israeli civilians, who are innocent victims of the cycle of violence driven by their government&#39;s policy. We also reject the use of these scattered actions to cast doubt on the legitimate exercise of self-defense by the Palestinian people, and to justify activities, which are widely or selectively committed against the Palestinian population.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/297:1	First, it is important to take into account two equally legitimate desires: on the one hand, there is the demand of minorities to live in security, to have the same opportunities for economic development, to have the same access to social services and education, and to exercise their right to return. ; On the other hand, there is the desire of the majority of the population to exercise its right to self-determination.	0

2004/s/pv_5049/82:3	This Council should not allow that strategy to be rewarded by responding to terrorism rather than addressing terrorism itself. Rather, it should be met with rejection, not appeasement.	0
2011/s/pv_6544/51:2	In this regard, the Council condemns, in the strongest terms, the continued threats and acts of intimidation against members of the Mission.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/332:1	Let me begin by reiterating the European Union&#39;s deep concern about the situation in Somalia and the regional repercussions resulting from the conflict there.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/250:1	While we are aware of the challenges that implementation tasks will face, we believe that sustainable development cannot be achieved in the region without effective institutions based on good governance and the availability of the necessary resources that can only be available under security and stability.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:1	A major issue in post-conflict countries is security sector reform.	0

2012/s/pv_6735/130:1	However, we are concerned by recent developments, including increased tensions between members of local communities and ISAF forces.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/225:2	However, the situation remains a source of concern, given the long border that separates our two countries, over which control is difficult to exercise.	3
2005/s/pv_5243/46:1	I would like to draw members&#39; attention to document S/2005/436, which contains the text of a letter dated 26 July 2005 addressed to the President of the Security Council from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/48:2	The operation went well, and was not accompanied by any major security incidents or incapacitating logistical challenges.	3
2007/s/pv_5683/62:1	The main Palestinian factions in Lebanon expressed concern about the incidents and distanced themselves from Fatah al-Islam.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/256:4	The Council must call for an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from the area.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/86:2	The limited ability within the region to track financial flows is another major challenge, especially given that illicit profits can exacerbate corruption.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/75:4	But let us be honest with each other - there is no issue in Kosovo that does not relate to the Centre, directly or indirectly.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/91:2	By thinking of taking initiatives that practically reward this strategy, the Council will only embolden the terrorists and undermine the letter and spirit of the road map.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/63:2	There is no doubt that we have underestimated the humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan. Mr. John Holmes will discuss this topic in detail.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/56:4	He refused to arrest Ali Kushayb and Ahmed Haroun.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/54:3	Throughout those difficult days and weeks, Kosovo&#39;s political leaders and citizens managed this largely exceptional situation maturely and without disruption or destabilization.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/290:1	Moreover, we have strengthened the focus of our efforts to be more effective in Afghanistan, especially in Kandahar Province.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/129:3	Here in the Security Council, there are three situations in particular that require our attention today.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/88:6	A one-state solution may satisfy many basic Palestinian desires, but it does not satisfy the Israelis&#39; essential requirement to maintain their self-determination and sovereignty.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/102:1	This situation continues even as the Libyan authorities do not have any opportunity to fully control the situation in their own country or to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist elements.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/118:2	The Palestinians must end public incitement to violence and do everything in their power to prevent extremists from attacking Israel, provoking an Israeli response.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/60:1	We are confident that these groups will not be able to undermine the electoral process at the national level.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/71:2	I spent four days in Afghanistan at the end of June assessing the humanitarian situation, given growing concerns about the difficult humanitarian situation and the issue of the protection of civilians.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/56:1	The Palestinians feel that the struggle is a battle of resistance that they wage every day for their identity and to prevent the disappearance of the possibility of having a future as a people.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/127:1	The situation on the ground is also worrying from a humanitarian perspective, and the Secretary-General confirms that Iraq is going through a major crisis, and stated that the situation is deteriorating.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/66:6	Although the reserve unit&#39;s formal training period officially ended on August 23, it is estimated that at least three additional months of intensive training and on-the-job supervision are needed.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/72:1	At the same time, Germany and the European Union have repeatedly in the past condemned terrorist crimes that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/87:3	Sustainable and effective democratic governance is a goal that must be pursued with great resolve, and even with a sense of what the situation requires, and that rapid action is needed everywhere, and Haiti is no exception.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/73:4	There is no doubt that the structure and development of public administration in Timor-Leste remains an important challenge that must be taken into account.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/273:3	This is what makes the Iranian leadership&#39;s irresponsible threatening rhetoric even more disturbing.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/53:4	It must maintain its independence and objectivity in order to instill confidence in the electoral process.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/61:1	Under international law, Israel is obligated, as the occupying state, to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, and is obligated to preserve civilian property.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/63:2	Improving this situation requires the enforcement of laws - in particular the law on the elimination of violence against women - that criminalize and punish violence and harmful practices against women and girls.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/65:1	Last Sunday, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of the Hamas movement, Hamas leader Haniyeh refused to allow President Abbas to remain in office until the internal division was resolved.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/337:1	As long as we are discussing the development challenges facing Afghanistan, the recent incident justifies the bleak picture regarding the security situation.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/224:4	In this context, the European Union reminds Israel of its commitment to ensuring full and safe access to humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/183:1	Although a senior official in the Provisional Institutions of Kosovo and Metohija recently tried to explain this failure by citing high unemployment rates, the facts point in another direction.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/312:2	Therefore, another serious challenge in the near future will be to build a sustainable economy fueled by a culture of democratic and transparent governance that creates employment opportunities and helps achieve the country&#39;s basic social missions.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/426:1	We consider Armenia&#39;s position an open and direct challenge to the conflict settlement process and a serious threat to international and regional peace and security.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/191:1	The Togolese delegation believes that all these issues require urgent action to prevent the Sahel region from falling into complete insecurity, which would be very detrimental to its development.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/111:1	At the same time, other essential elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by increasing the effectiveness, integrity and overall performance of the judiciary, and strengthening law enforcement institutions with a view to reducing organized crime and ethnic violence and bringing all criminals to justice.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/98:2	This will require a clear position, especially, frankly, from the United States of America.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/108:2	We address these challenges in democratic and effective ways.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/265:3	It is clear that continued international assistance is required, and as the Secretary-General noted in his report,	3
2011/s/pv_6548/50:1	At the same time, President Al-Bashir threatens the international community with retaliation, and thus more crimes.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/117:1	In the current situation, which is an extremely difficult situation, we call on both Israelis and Palestinians to prevent escalation of the conflict and to begin implementing their obligations under the road map, in order to revive the prospects for peace.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/188:8	We now have a better understanding of the scale of the challenges that we could previously only guess at.	3
2011/s/pv_6688/52:2	If these matters are resolved in favor of the Public Prosecutor, the two defendants will plead guilty to the charges against them.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/115:2	He added that the incident would undermine peace, security and stability in the country.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/212:2	Despite these challenges, we cannot fail to acknowledge that approximately 50 percent of the Afghan people live in areas where responsibility for security has been transferred to the Afghan security forces.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/211:1	The humanitarian consequences of continuing violence in Iraq are a source of grave concern to my delegation.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/145:2	Minorities, especially the Serb minority, have a fundamental duty to fully engage in the search for solutions by taking advantage of all available opportunities to participate in Kosovo&#39;s institutions.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/229:3	It is time for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most basic rights of the Palestinian people, and to break the vicious cycle of violence resulting from Israel&#39;s continuing and ongoing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/326:1	Brazil is also convinced that a stable Somalia requires the development of a comprehensive strategy that combines security and development.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/110:2	All of this requires waging a powerful war against entrenched informal actors, whose presence poses a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of its sovereignty by the Afghan state.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/333:7	We are disappointed, Mr. President, that despite your efforts and the efforts of many others, the Council was unable to condemn that brutal terrorist attack.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/174:4	But despite these achievements, challenges to the government&#39;s authority and effective control over its national territory still need to be overcome.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/408:3	It is also indisputable that Armenia, as the occupying power, bears direct responsibility for the commission of these crimes.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/295:1	In order to achieve more significant and robust progress, the international community should act in a more coherent and determined manner to establish the necessary basic framework.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/64:1	The political deadlock within the Transitional Federal Parliament poses another challenge.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/171:2	In that context, we remain concerned about the most vulnerable groups in Timor-Leste: the poor and the displaced.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/84:4	It is part of a mantra that is constantly repeated before this Council, and the repetition does not make it more true. It ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights, and does not acknowledge the excessive difficulties faced by Israeli forces in trying to protect their citizens and minimize harm to Palestinian lives while terrorists do not Those you face care more about the lives of Palestinians than they care about the lives of Israelis.	0
2006/s/pv_5465/36:1	The session opened at 20:20.	0
2007/s/pv_5788/68:3	We note the security concerns that Israel says force it to continue its aircraft flights, especially allegations of violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to Resolution 1701 (2006).	3
2008/s/pv_6049/229:4	Today I will only emphasize the following four points.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/74:5	The lack of land and jobs, as well as insecurity, prevent many returnees from settling in their communities of origin.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/154:2	The German government strongly condemns these acts of violence.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/404:1	Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): First of all, I would like to apologize for requesting the floor again, as we considered that it would be inappropriate and unproductive to ignore the comments made by the representative of Armenia and his attempt to mislead the Security Council into silence about them.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/239:1	The continuing plight and suffering of the Palestinian people remains a tragic embodiment of the consequences of refusing to implement Security Council resolutions and the failure of the Security Council to enforce its decisions.	3
2008/s/pv_5919/36:1	The session opened at 10:18.	3
2007/s/pv_5788/54:2	Early this month, Prime Minister Fayyad circulated a summary of the Palestinian reform and development plan for the period 2008-2010.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/112:2	This political incident was strongly denounced through a press release issued by the office of President Ernest Bai Kroma, as well as by numerous press releases issued by political interest groups, including the APC, the People&#39;s Movement for Democratic Change and the Independent Commission for the Media. The Political Parties Registration Committee and the Good Governance Campaign.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/152:4	We could go on to mention widespread poverty, problems in natural resource management, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, thousands more former combatants awaiting reintegration, unreformed security sectors, extensive human rights violations, and many other threats that are likely to fueling a new conflict.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/89:2	In that regard, we believe that destructive action aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be absolutely condemned.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/91:1	While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemn the incident and demand the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has claimed that the other side is responsible for provoking the incident.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/161:3	We would also like to express our concern that the return of these incidents could lead to an unstable situation in the region, making it difficult to achieve a peaceful solution to the Kosovo situation that is acceptable to both parties.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/75:3	Israel must also refrain from taking unilateral actions in Jerusalem that would change the status quo or undermine confidence.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/205:2	Combined with fanaticism and deep roots in the political and social life of the region, organized crime threatens the very foundation of principles and values that we are trying to instill in the new institutions formed there, and thus our efforts are in vain.	0
2010/s/pv_6259/58:5	As a result, the threshold for security threats to many countries in Africa and beyond, including Member States of this Council, has been crossed, exposing their vulnerabilities.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/59:1	In addition to the humanitarian challenges, the situation raises security concerns.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/201:2	As we have always emphasized, that position does not involve pre-judging the essence of the issue; Rather, it is a firm call to give both justice and the political process a chance.	3
2004/s/pv_4952/90:4	But accomplishing the mission is not impossible if we set realistic goals based on principles and move forward towards them with deliberate steps, and if we have the support of others and are not alone when we take those steps.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/202:1	As a measure to optimize the use of the Council&#39;s time and to allow as many delegations as possible to speak, I will not invite individual speakers to take seats at the Council table and then to return to their seats at the side of the room.	0
2009/s/pv_6230/135:3	The failure of any Member State to comply with its obligations under the Charter should have consequences, and Sudan should not be exempt from this.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/105:2	As I have stressed on numerous occasions, lasting security and stability for any country, as well as for Timor-Leste, will only be achieved in conjunction with socio-economic development.	3
2012/s/pv_6729/224:2	We believe that Somalia faces a challenge similar to that of a marathon runner, because the drafting of the constitution must be completed by 20 April and its adoption completed by 22 May.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/213:3	The impunity of these high-ranking officers is unacceptable and prevents post-conflict societies from recovering sustainably.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/282:1	The Afghan authorities and the international community must make clear that this behavior is unacceptable.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/187:5	Pristina has so far rejected every initiative in this regard.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/108:3	In this regard, the measures taken to address the serious problems in the correctional system are encouraging despite the serious challenges that remain.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/69:2	Although the President acted within his constitutional powers, I discussed with him concerns regarding the possibility that the pardons issued on 25 December 2009 might reinforce the perception of impunity.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/72:1	The Arab Spring reaffirms what history warns of: that when governments respond with an iron fist to their citizens&#39; irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands, and irrepressible hopes, they are doomed to collapse in the long term.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/52:2	The progress achieved, and I hope there is no doubt that some progress has been made, must be viewed in the context of the challenges facing Kosovo.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/250:3	First, it caused an ongoing humanitarian emergency that also threatened peace and stability in Haiti.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/259:7	Developing effective Somali judicial capacity will also enable Somalis to address the scourge of terrorism and piracy.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/308:2	It is clear that collective efforts require greater resources and a better integration process - a fact embodied in the Bucharest and Paris outcome documents.	0
2006/s/pv_5465/54:1	Therefore, Greece insists on the need to clarify the sixth preambular paragraph - urging the Council “to make progress towards the resumption of negotiations to reach a comprehensive settlement” - as it should be emphasized once again that those negotiations should take place between the two communities.	3
2010/s/pv_6259/100:1	In that regard, we would like to go further to say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to enable the Somali security forces to subdue the most powerful insurgents and enable the Government to expand its areas of authority as much as possible if peace negotiations fail.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/276:2	In his report, the Secretary-General notes some improvement measures in all of these areas except for the central issue of local government reform, in particular, decentralization, where progress is lacking.	3

2005/s/pv_5188/116:2	In return, the authorities in Belgrade must end their obstructionist method, which prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo&#39;s public institutions. The “vacancy policy” entails great risks in writing the history of Kosovo without the participation of Kosovo Serbs.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/140:2	The Haitian National Police needs sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its constitutional law enforcement duty.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/102:2	Likewise, I can see the need for the international community to direct its attention and resources to other hotbeds of tension around the world.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/101:1	We are particularly concerned about the indiscriminate proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond its borders as a result of the conflict.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/158:3	This would truly demonstrate the global nature of the United Nations&#39; counter-terrorism efforts and the fact that Member States are united.	3

2008/s/pv_6049/76:2	We urge Israel to take further measures to remove advanced settlement sites in accordance with the road map, and to address the growing threat posed by settler extremism.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/161:2	A greater United Nations presence is indeed vital, but for the added value of our Organization to be fully effective, adequate funds must be provided for both staff and security. Mr. Eddy reminded us of that a few moments ago.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/77:1	As for the military aspects of security sector reform, the government has made clear that it wants to rely largely on bilateral aid to build the military&#39;s capabilities.	3
2005/s/pv_5188/286:4	In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the continuing lack of progress in the areas of freedom of movement of minorities, sustainable returns and the relevant representation of minorities in government structures and in the public sector as a whole.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/184:1	My Government acknowledges the many expressions of condemnation and outrage that have resulted from this terrible incident. We particularly appreciate the Security Council&#39;s quick reaction to this heinous crime.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/238:4	In fact, given the history of foreign intervention, such directives would not only be questioned by various sectors of society but could also exacerbate the problem.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/136:1	Above all, our concerns were related to the insistence of the Pristina authorities to implement the so-called strategy for northern Kosovo in flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which remains the main international legal framework for reaching a settlement in Kosovo.	3
2005/s/pv_5336/44:1	The members of the Council have before them document S/2005/745, which contains the text of a letter dated 7 December 2005 addressed to the President of the Security Council from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) on Liberia transmitting the report of the Group of Experts on Liberia.	3
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/55:1	In particular, we would like to express our deep concern about the stagnation in Haiti&#39;s socio-economic development and food security.	0
2010/s/pv_6276/214:3	But we note that without a strong justice and security sector, developing peace and stability can be threatened.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/166:1	The international community has clearly expressed its strong condemnation of these actions, through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Group of Friends of Syria, with significant and widespread participation.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/324:4	The five or six incidents in the border areas - at least the incidents that were reported - occurred in places like Ninghar and Zabul, near the Pakistani border.	0
2012/s/pv_6729/299:6	This is a matter of great urgency, because Kenya cannot continue to bear the burden resulting from this situation.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/92:2	Clearly, the Executive Directorate must continue its efforts to achieve those goals.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/260:4	The threat posed by terrorists, criminals and those involved in the drug trade to the security and stability of Afghanistan is a real phenomenon that must be constantly addressed.	3

2006/s/pv_5603/227:4	We cannot risk wasting human and financial investment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo due to citizens&#39; frustration, which could ultimately lead to a renewed crisis.	3
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/187:4	It would be remiss of the Council not to use these tools if the need arises.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/276:2	Under these circumstances, in which huge disparities and political, economic, and social marginalization combine, a process has emerged that seeks to bring about change in the prevailing system, and seeks to bring about economic and political change and find alternatives that allow participation and open new areas and means of expression, which include, in short, demands related to basic rights.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/241:1	UNIFIL soldiers must fully implement their mandate with the aim of eliminating threats emanating from Afghanistan.	0
2010/s/pv_6353/165:1	My delegation believes that to prevent new outbreaks of violence and to stabilize northern Kosovo, it remains essential that the reconciliation process be accompanied by policies aimed at ensuring social and economic stability among the communities in a non-discriminatory manner.	3
2011/s/pv_6662/49:3	Withholding this level of funding would paralyze any government, let alone an authority under occupation, and if these funds are not immediately released, this action will threaten the state-building gains achieved by the Palestinian Authority, including promoting good governance that benefits the people. Palestinian security forces and the development of security forces that maintain law and order in the West Bank.	0
2004/s/pv_5077/54:2	As members of the Security Council know better than anyone, the Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the most enduring diplomatic challenges the world has faced since the mid-twentieth century. At the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a conflict between competing and contradictory historical narratives, aspirations and collective identities.	3
2008/s/pv_5855/160:1	Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a concern shared by all Member States of the United Nations and the international community as a whole.	3

2005/s/pv_5243/34:1	The situation relating to the Democratic Republic of the Congo	3
2004/s/pv_5025/232:2	But the serious danger remains that as a result of that decision - which violates the documents issued by the Bonn and Berlin conferences - the country will face an explosive situation fraught with new armed resistance and internal divisions in the power structures.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/265:1	Finding a starting point for discussions about the upcoming challenges that Middle Eastern societies find themselves facing and extrapolating the promising opportunities emerging from these challenges can be a daunting task.	3
2006/s/pv_5603/251:1	Addressing the root causes of the economic deficit requires the establishment of permanent projects based on sound commercial and economic foundations, especially since the region enjoys a distinguished strategic location on the African continent and enormous natural resources.	0

2011/s/pv_6495/57:1	Since the report&#39;s release, there has been a significant increase in focus on Liberia&#39;s border with Côte d&#39;Ivoire.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/265:1	In assessing that progress, it is important to acknowledge the great strides Timor-Leste has come in just a few years since independence, but it is equally important to acknowledge the significant challenges that still lie ahead.	3
2007/s/pv_5788/58:1	I would also like to emphasize effective Arab diplomacy in the period leading up to the conference.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/145:2	Preventing illegal border crossings is vital to combating terrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling.	3
2004/s/pv_4952/69:5	There are certainly people who feel uncomfortable with what they see as an excessive and, in fact, negative preoccupation with sectarian balance.	0
2008/s/pv_5930/59:3	Although about 80 percent of Afghans depend directly on agriculture for their livelihood, only a small portion of our efforts have been invested in this sector.	3
2004/s/pv_5024/129:2	Unless the Government addresses these issues, they could represent serious threats to the security and stability of Timor-Leste.	0
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/87:2	However, prevention will only be effective if peacekeeping operations have the resources they need to implement their mandate.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/271:4	The ability of the Palestinian Authority to build reliable institutions and basic security facilities, with the will and ability to combat terrorism and other threats, constitutes an essential element in the process of building the Palestinian state and a legitimate aspiration on the Israeli side.	0
2005/s/pv_5188/287:1	Clearly, ultimate progress in these areas will require more concerted efforts by the international community, Belgrade and the people of Kosovo.	0

2012/s/pv_6734/171:5	To avoid a new wave of violence, both parties and the international community must take immediate action.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/169:2	In order to restore real stability, a comprehensive and broad approach is needed, consisting of a wide range of legal, political and international tools.	3
2001/s/pv_4314/35:1	The session opened at 3 p.m	0
2004/s/pv_5049/208:1	While we strongly condemn these practices as they represent a flagrant violation of international conventions and humanitarian laws and norms, we call on the international community, the members of the Quartet, and all active parties to intervene immediately and decisively to force Israel to put an end to such actions, which constitute a serious threat to security and stability in the Middle East region. Violence only begets violence, which may plunge the region into a spiral from which it is difficult to emerge.	0
2012/s/pv_6735/246:3	This is particularly true with regard to the political sphere and the security situation.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/265:2	In that regard, we are deeply concerned about the security situation in Afghanistan, which has deteriorated since last year as a result of the repressive activities of remaining elements of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, warlord disputes and drug trafficking.	0

2010/s/pv_6276/255:2	It is important to present the image and acceptance of the police in society as the primary law enforcement agency.	0
2011/s/pv_6662/42:2	Although these contacts have been constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the two parties are expected to submit proposals regarding territory and security within 90 days, have not yet taken place.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/151:4	Although this is a good start, its long-term sustainability will only be achieved if the government makes complementary efforts to address other socio-economic challenges.	0
2008/s/pv_6024/68:2	We need peace to meet other enormous challenges.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/163:1	Economic issues, such as investment, are also a major concern.	0
2004/s/pv_5025/235:1	In this context, Russia is convinced of the importance of developing a comprehensive international strategy to combat drugs in Afghanistan, including establishing a security belt along the Afghan border.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/82:1	Sierra Leone is also witnessing a boom in investment in the extractive industry sector.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/69:2	Some of these countries face enormous challenges, and there will be setbacks as well as progress in the coming years.	0
2011/s/pv_6618/150:3	We urge the Government of Haiti to take firm action to prevent such violence and ensure that the perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice.	3

2010/s/pv_6297/58:7	These are issues that must be addressed within the framework of security sector reform efforts.	0
2004/s/pv_4934/65:1	The Russian Federation once again calls on the Israeli and Palestinian sides to exercise restraint, a high spirit of responsibility, and to reject unilateralism.	3
2009/s/pv_6111/53:1	I cannot stress enough the threat that the unavailability of military helicopters poses to the operational effectiveness of the force.	0

2004/s/pv_4952/83:2	Some Iraqi interlocutors have raised questions about that term – “national reconciliation” – in terms of what it entails and what it requires.	0
2009/s/pv_6236/52:4	As indicated in the report, the period under review witnessed important achievements in the peace process and in preparations for the 2010 elections, despite some existing challenges.	0
2009/s/pv_6111/58:1	Beyond the area of responsibility of the United Nations Mission in Eastern Chad, other developments are also causing concern.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/110:6	Representative democracy also requires citizens to have confidence in the governments they elect.	0
2004/s/pv_5024/165:1	Also, although the overall security situation remains calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste officially assumed full responsibility for security on 20 May, smuggling, illicit trafficking and illegal border crossings should be seen as a cause for concern, as well as Tensions related to demonstrations that took place in Dili last July.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/126:2	Lack of such engagement will prevent progress in addressing important issues of public administration, and will achieve no progress in improving Kosovo&#39;s image in the minds of the international community.	0
2007/s/pv_5693/58:1	Fortunately, the choices before the Iraqi people are not black and white; Nor are they zero options. There are a whole host of compromise gray areas that can address the fundamental concerns of all participants in the political process.	0
2006/s/pv_5492/59:1	Despite our assessment that achieving a complete ceasefire is difficult at this time, I still believe that the international community must make its position clear, which is the need to stop the attacks immediately, and for Israel to make more credible efforts to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, while Work is being done urgently to create the conditions to stop these attacks.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/271:1	The review of the security situation contained in the Special Report of the Secretary-General (S/2008/434) suggests that, despite the tireless efforts of the Afghan people and the international community, serious challenges to peace and stability remain in Afghanistan.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/188:3	The Court of First Instance’s push to issue an arrest warrant against a head of state on March 4, 2009, sparked massive popular reactions and dealt a new setback to hopes for peace and stability.	0

2011/s/pv_6688/54:3	However, in 2007, after issuing arrest warrants for Haroun and Kushayb, President Al-Bashir publicly refused to implement them, challenging the authority of the Security Council and saying that Haroun had done what he was ordered to do.	0
2003/s/pv_4770/110:2	The current political situation in Kosovo highlights facts that contradict these basic assertions, and we hope that they will be part of the educational process to achieve democratic stability.	3
1999/s/pv_3969/39:3	In this context, the Council reaffirms that the main cause of the crisis in Angola is UNITA&#39;s refusal to comply with the relevant substantive provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, and reiterates its request that UNITA comply with its obligations to disarm and allow governmental administration to extend to the territory it controls.	0
2011/s/pv_6609/115:1	In describing this unfortunate incident, the President stressed that it was malicious, unacceptable, and entailed potential violence in the upcoming 2012 elections.	3

2012/s/pv_6709/100:2	Moreover, the negative impact of the crisis is also evident beyond Libya&#39;s borders and not only on the African continent.	0

2009/s/pv_6230/125:2	During those consideration sessions, the Chinese delegation has always stressed the view that the Darfur issue involves a political process, the deployment of peacekeepers, economic development, humanitarian assistance and the establishment of justice. It is a very complex issue and requires a tremendous amount of political wisdom to find a comprehensive solution that ensures peace and justice.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/195:4	While it is possible to overthrow a new leader in just a few months, building such a democratic society requires more time and sacrifices.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/72:4	If not, we could see more violent defections that can occur when people demand their rights, as there is no force to forcibly prevent them from giving them up.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/307:4	In that context, we believe it is important for the Security Council to pay the utmost attention to the threats posed by fundamentalist and extremist religious organizations such as Hizb ut-Tahrir and we urge the Council to impose severe sanctions on terrorist organizations.	3

2008/s/pv_6049/88:1	In accordance with the understanding reached by Council members, I would like to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes so that the Council can quickly carry out its work.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/152:2	It is up to the people and leaders of the region to resist the demagogues&#39; calls, reach compromises and build coalitions, continue to trust their regimes even when they lose in elections, and protect the principles and institutions that will ultimately protect them.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/284:2	We believe that Palestine will remain the greatest challenge in the Middle East.	0
2008/s/pv_5855/154:2	This is directly related to the credibility of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate.	0
2004/s/pv_5049/217:2	Therefore, the international community must take the necessary action to prevent Israel from continuing the reprehensible process of destruction it has initiated in Gaza, and affirm its rejection of all these Israeli practices that constitute a violation of international law and international humanitarian law.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/154:2	Although unexpected, these changes prove an old rule of political science: lack of reform leads to revolution.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/194:5	This remains a source of constant concern to us.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/261:1	Although the solution to the Palestinian tragedy that has spanned six decades will have a significant impact on the situation in the Middle East, peace in the region also requires progress on the other axes of the peace process.	0
2012/s/pv_6734/114:3	Therefore, I also deliberately avoided addressing other topics that some consider necessary when discussing the Middle East, such as the necessity of resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or the situation in Syria, since we have addressed these issues in other sessions held by the Council.	3

2012/s/pv_6734/149:1	No one in the region is exempt from the demands for change that we have witnessed.	0
2012/s/pv_6709/177:1	The security challenges coming from the Sahel-Sahara region are not new.	3
2006/s/pv_5466/51:3	Here too we received responses that seemed to justify our concerns.	0

2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/143:1	When the situation in Haiti is addressed within the framework of the United Nations, all attention is almost always focused on so-called security issues, which in practice reduces the urgent attention needed to the country&#39;s serious structural, economic and social problems.	0

2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/184:3	The Rome Statute, adopted early that year, was a huge step forward as it explicitly integrated sexual violence, such as rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution and forced pregnancy, into an international legal framework for the first time.

2010/s/pv_6353/103:3	Some of the accusations reported in the newspapers are merely speculation and it is important that investigations are conducted with the necessary calm.	0

2010/s/pv_6276/298:4	We note that civil society organizations have expressed their deep concern in this regard.	3
2007/s/pv_5693/61:2	It is clear that all institutions of law and order in Iraq face serious challenges.	3

2011/s/pv_6618/237:4	However, we believe that a sudden withdrawal will have adverse results and will create an unprecedented vacuum, especially in light of the fact that the conditions conducive to the hoped-for, large-scale investment and sustainable development have not yet been fully established.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/333:1	At the outset, I must express our deep concern about the security situation in this country.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/105:1	I must say that the topic chosen for our discussion today is very challenging although it is interesting.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/185:3	As the Secretary-General&#39;s report (S/2004/634) makes clear, tackling the problem is a difficult challenge.	3
2003/s/pv_4770/162:1	However, my delegation notes with regret that the security situation remains a cause for concern.	3

Development experts and the international community.	3
2004/s/pv_5049/93:1	Sadly, the current Palestinian leadership has proven that it is as incapable of being a partner in peace as it is of seeking reform and democratic governance for its people.	3
2012/s/pv_6735/163:1	First and foremost, security concerns remain paramount.	3
2009/s/pv_6230/101:6	It is clear that the conditions for applying this mechanism are not available in the case of Darfur.	3
2011/s/pv_6609/86:1	First, while Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West African Sahel Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere hampers intelligence sharing and early warning.	3

2005/s/pv_5188/335:1	Second, Mr. Covic expressed concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority - the Kosovo Serbs - risk losing out to mechanical majority voting. I would say that I think the most important aspect of democracy that can be expected is for one to participate, exercise democratic rights and vote.	3
2008/s/pv_6049/308:1	We express our deep concern about the plight of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/44:3	In Egypt, we have been calling for the early and peaceful transfer of power to a civilian government.	3

2011/s/pv_6618/139:2	The challenges facing the country require Haitian leaders to have a common and unified will.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/65:1	However, the possibility of a complete collapse of law and order, in addition to the collapse of the fragile economy and the disintegration of Palestinian institutions of self-government, remains.	3
2012/s/pv_6709/128:4	The negative impact of the Libyan situation will grow, which poses a threat to continued peace and stability in the region. China expresses its deep concern in this regard.	0
2011/s/pv_6495/73:1	One thing that remains a major concern of mine is that the efforts that Liberians are making to rebuild their judicial system will take a long time, so the system itself is likely to remain weak and vulnerable in the short term.	3
2004/s/pv_5077/78:6	In 1993, that vision was vague at best, and at the time, it was impossible to define an ultimate goal that would come close to meeting the concerns of both peoples.	3

2011/s/pv_6609/96:1	We took note of the concern regarding the implementation of the joint statement of 2 April 2009, which was referred to in the report.	3
2010/s/pv_6297/62:2	This sparked serious tensions with local communities, as well as threats to MINURSO from some former military commanders of the Conference who have now integrated into the Congolese army.	3
2010/s/pv_6353/140:2	We consider any deviation from that principle unacceptable, not to mention that the fragile situation in the region may lead to the spread of instability.	3

2004/s/pv_5025/320:2	As the United Nations Support Mission in Afghanistan, we would be irresponsible if we did not appeal to the international community, the Government of Pakistan, the Government of Afghanistan and its national forces to end that situation, especially on the southern border.	3
2006/s/pv_5492/55:3	While I regret the actions taken by Hezbollah, and as I said, Israel has the right to defend itself, the use of excessive force must be condemned.	3
2008/s/pv_5930/108:1	Pakistan&#39;s new democratic government has inherited a daunting legacy of political, economic and security challenges.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/234:4	Further development of the situation in this direction could threaten efforts to reform and build the country, and in the long term it would threaten peace and stability throughout the region.	3

2004/s/pv_5024/173:2	We are particularly concerned about the lack of training for mid-level civil servants, in addition to the significant problems that continue to surround the judicial field.	3

2011/s/pv_6618/58:1	I am particularly concerned about the instability that could arise if the political and socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate.	0
2008/s/pv_6049/285:3	However, the matter requires an American will that puts peace in the Middle East as its priority, overcoming the neglect and absence that lasted for about seven years and led to the worsening of the situation in the region.	3
2011/s/pv_6662/35:1	The session opened at 10.3 p.m.	3
2011/s/pv_6495/48:5	However, this was not so serious as to interfere with the operation. The simplicity of logistics makes it difficult to successfully vote twice on Election Day.	3

2004/s/pv_4934/114:4	Statements such as “The Palestinian people do not love their children” or “The Palestinian people are sending their children to death because of their hatred for Israel” are statements that smack of racism and reflect the kind of approach that should be rejected outright - and I am trying to do that now.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/176:4	Sharing blame, creating scapegoats who bear responsibility for the failure in Afghanistan, and demanding that those who actually do a lot do the most unfair and unacceptable practices will ultimately lead to psychological defeat.	3
2004/s/pv_4934/108:2	We cannot send a message that terrorists will be safe and be satisfied with the usual condemnations.	3
2010/s/pv_6276/91:4	Many achievements have been achieved, but many challenges still lie ahead.	3
2004/s/pv_5025/124:5	The recent fatwa issued by the Ulema Council condemning drug and other related activities could be very helpful in thwarting opium poppy production.	3
2011/s/pv_6618/286:3	We therefore urge the members of the Council and the Group of Friends of Haiti to view positively these recommendations made by the Secretary-General.	3
2012/s/pv_6734/113:4	It appears that people not only aspire to, but also demand that more pluralistic and representative governments provide tangible benefits to their citizens.	3
